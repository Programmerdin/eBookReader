         <a id="page61"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> Excavators and their steam shovel predecessors are huge pieces of capital equipment sold to excavation contractors. While
         few observers consider this a fast-moving, technologically dynamic industry, it has points in common with the disk drive industry:
         Over its history, leading firms have successfully adopted a series of <em class="calibre2">sustaining</em> innovations, both incremental and radical, in components and architecture, but almost the entire population of mechanical
         shovel manufacturers was wiped out by a disruptive technology—hydraulics—that the leaders’ customers and their economic structure
         had caused them initially to ignore. Although in disk drives such invasions of established markets occurred within a few years
         of the initial emergence of each disruptive technology, the triumph of hydraulic excavators took twenty years. Yet the disruptive
         invasion proved just as decisive and difficult to counter in excavators as those in the disk drive industry.
