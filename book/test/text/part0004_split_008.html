<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_8">HARNESSING THE PRINCIPLES OF DISRUPTIVE<br class="calibre1"/>INNOVATION</h1>
      <p class="p">Colleagues who have read my academic papers reporting the findings recounted in <a href="part0006_split_000.html">chapters 1</a> through <a href="part0009_split_000.html">4</a> were struck by their
         near-fatalism. If good management practice drives the failure of successful firms faced with disruptive technological change,
         then the usual answers to companies’ problems—planning better, working harder, becoming more customer-driven, and taking a
         longer-term perspective—all <em class="calibre2">exacerbate</em> the problem. Sound execution, speed-to-market, total quality management, and process reengineering are similarly ineffective.
         Needless to say, this is disquieting news to people who teach future managers!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><a href="part0011_split_000.html">Chapters 5</a> through <a href="part0016_split_000.html">10</a>, however, suggest that although the solution to disruptive technologies cannot be found in the standard
         tool kit of good management, there are, in fact, sensible ways to deal effectively with this challenge. Every company in every
         industry works under certain forces—laws of organizational nature—that act powerfully to define what that company can and
         cannot do. Managers faced with disruptive technologies fail their companies when these forces overpower them.

      <p class="calibre5">By analogy, the ancients who attempted to fly by strapping feathered wings to their arms and flapping with all their might
         as they leapt from high places invariably failed. Despite their dreams and hard work, they 
         <a id="pagexix"></a>were fighting against some very powerful forces of nature. No one could be strong enough to win this fight. Flight became
         possible only after people came to understand the relevant natural laws and principles that defined how the world worked:
         the law of gravity, Bernoulli’s principle, and the concepts of lift, drag, and resistance. When people then designed flying
         systems that recognized or harnessed the power of these laws and principles, rather than fighting them, they were finally
         able to fly to heights and distances that were previously unimaginable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The objective of <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapters 5</a> through <a href="part0016_split_000.html">10</a> is to propose the existence of five laws or principles of disruptive technology. As
         in the analogy with manned flight, these laws are so strong that managers who ignore or fight them are nearly powerless to
         pilot their companies through a disruptive technology storm. These chapters show, however, that if managers can understand
         and harness these forces, rather than fight them, they can in fact succeed spectacularly when confronted with disruptive technological
         change. I am particularly anxious that managers read these chapters for <em class="calibre2">understanding</em>, rather than for simple answers. I am very confident that the great managers about whom this book is written will be very
         capable on their own of finding the answers that best fit their circumstances. But they must first understand what has caused
         those circumstances and what forces will affect the feasibility of their solutions. The following paragraphs summarize these
         principles and what managers can do to harness or accommodate them.
