      <p class="p">Clark’s concept of technological hierarchies (see note 4) focuses on the skills and technological understanding that a company
         accumulates as the result of the product and process technology problems it has addressed in the past. In evaluating the threat
         to the disk drive makers of flash memory, someone using Clark’s framework, or the related findings of Tushman and Anderson
         (see note 5), would focus on the extent to which disk drive makers have historically developed expertise in integrated circuit
         design and in the design and control of devices composed of multiple integrated circuits. These frameworks would lead us to
         expect that drive makers will stumble badly in their attempts to develop flash products if they have limited expertise in
         these domains and will succeed if their experience and expertise are deep.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">On its surface, flash memory involves radically different <em class="calibre2">electronics</em> technology than the core competence of disk drive makers (magnetics and mechanics). But such firms as Quantum, Seagate, and
         Western Digital have developed deep expertise in custom integrated circuit design through embedding increasingly intelligent
         control circuitry and cache memory in their drives. Consistent with the practice in much of the ASIC (application-specific
         integrated circuit) industry, their controller chips are fabricated by independent, third-party fabricators that own excess
         clean room semiconductor processing capacity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Each of today’s leading disk drive manufacturers got its start by designing drives, procuring components from independent
         suppliers, assembling them either in its own factories or by contract, and then selling them. The flash card business is very
         similar. Flash card makers design the card and procure the component flash chips; they design and have fabricated an interface
         circuit, such as SCSI, to govern the drive’s interaction with the computing device; they assemble them either in-house or
         by contract; and they then market them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In other words, flash memory actually <em class="calibre2">builds upon</em> important competencies that many drive makers have developed. The capabilities viewpoint, therefore, would lead us to expect
         that disk drive makers may <em class="calibre2">not</em> stumble badly in bringing flash storage technology to the market. More specifically, the viewpoint predicts that those firms
         with the deepest experience in IC 
         <a id="page50"></a>design—Quantum, Seagate, and Western Digital—will bring flash products to market quite readily. Others, which historically
         outsourced much of their electronic circuit design, may face more of a struggle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This has, indeed, been the case to date. Seagate entered the flash market in 1993 via its purchase of a 25 percent equity
         stake in Sundisk Corporation. Seagate and SunDisk together designed the chips and cards; the chips were fabricated by Matsushita,
         and the cards were assembled by a Korean manufacturer, Anam. Seagate itself marketed the cards. Quantum entered with a different
         partner, Silicon Storage Technology, which designed the chips that were then fabricated and assembled by contract.
