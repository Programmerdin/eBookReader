<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_12">SUMMARY</h1>
      <p class="p">Managers whose organizations are confronting change must first determine that they have the resources required to succeed.
         They then need to ask a separate question: does the organization have the processes and values to succeed? Asking this second
         question is not as instinctive for most managers because the processes by which work is done and the values by which employees
         make their decisions have served them well. What I hope this framework adds to managers’ thinking, however, is that the very
         capabilities of their organizations also define their disabilities. A little time spent soul-searching for honest answers
         to this issue will pay off handsomely. Are the processes by which work habitually gets done in 
         <a id="page181"></a>the organization appropriate for this new problem? And will the values of the organization cause this initiative to get high
         priority, or to languish?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">If the answer to these questions is no, it’s okay. Understanding problems is the most crucial step in solving them. Wishful
         thinking about this issue can set teams charged with developing and implementing an innovation on a course fraught with roadblocks,
         second-guessing, and frustration. The reasons why innovation often seems to be so difficult for established firms is that
         they employ highly capable people, and then set them to work within processes and values that weren’t designed to facilitate
         success with the task at hand. Ensuring that capable people are ensconced in capable organizations is a major management responsibility
         in an age such as ours, when the ability to cope with accelerating change has become so critical.
