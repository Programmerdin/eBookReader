      <p class="p">Control Data Corporation (CDC) effected the same self-reconstitution— once. CDC was the dominant manufacturer of 14-inch drives
         sold into the OEM market between 1965 and 1982; its market share fluctuated between 55 and 62 percent. When the 8-inch architecture
         emerged in the late 1970s, however, CDC missed it—by three years. The company never captured more than a fraction of the 8-inch
         market, and those 8-inch drives that it did sell were sold almost exclusively to defend its established customer base of mainframe
         computer manufacturers. The reason was resources and managerial emphasis: Engineers and marketers at the company’s principal
         Minneapolis facility kept getting pulled off the 8-inch program to resolve problems in the launch of next-generation 14-inch
         products for CDC’s mainstream customers.

      <p class="calibre5">CDC launched its first 5.25-inch model two years after Seagate’s pioneering 
         <a id="page106"></a>product appeared in 1980. This time, however, CDC located its 5.25-inch effort in Oklahoma City. This was done, according
         to one manager, “not to escape CDC’s Minneapolis engineering culture, but to isolate the [5.25-inch product] group from the
         company’s mainstream customers.” Although it was late in the market and never regained its former dominant position, CDC’s
         foray into 5.25-inch drives was profitable, and at times the firm commanded a 20 percent share of higher-capacity 5.25-inch
         drives.
