<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_15">FLASH MEMORY AND THE VALUE NETWORK</h1>
      <p class="p">The predictive power of the value network framework is currently being tested with the emergence of <em class="calibre2">flash memory:</em> a solid-state semiconductor memory technology that stores data on silicon memory chips. Flash differs from conventional dynamic
         random access memory (DRAM) technology in that the chip retains the data even when the power is off. Flash memory is a disruptive
         technology. Flash chips consume less than 5 percent of the power that a disk drive of equivalent capacity would consume, and
         because they have no moving parts, they are far more rugged than disk memory. Flash chips have disadvantages, of course. Depending
         on the amount of memory, the cost per megabyte of flash can be between five and fifty times greater than disk memory. And
         flash chips are not as robust for writing: They can only be overwritten a few hundred thousand times before wearing out, rather
         than a few million times for disk drives.

      <p class="calibre5">The initial applications for flash memory were in value networks quite distant from computing; they were in devices such as
         cellular phones, heart monitoring devices, modems, and industrial robots in which individually packaged flash chips were embedded.
         Disk drives were too big, too fragile, and used too much power to be used in these markets. By 1994, these applications for
         individually packaged flash chips—“socket flash” in industry parlance—accounted for $1.3 billion in industry revenues, having
         grown from nothing in 1987.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In the early 1990s, the flash makers produced a new product format, called a flash card: credit card–sized devices on which
         multiple flash chips, linked and governed by controller circuitry, were mounted. The chips on flash cards were controlled
         by the same control circuitry, SCSI (Small Computer Standard Interface, an acronym first used by Apple), as was used in disk
         drives, meaning that in concept, a flash card could be used like a disk drive for mass storage. The flash card market grew
         from $45 million in 1993 to $80 million in 1994, and forecasters were eyeing a $230 million flash card market by 1996.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Will flash cards invade the disk drive makers’ core markets and supplant magnetic memory? If they do, what will happen to
         the disk drive makers? 
         <a id="page49"></a>Will they stay atop their markets, catching this new technological wave? Or will they be driven out?
