      <p class="p">It is possible to break out of this system of customer control, however. Three cases in the history of the disk drive industry
         demonstrate how managers can develop strong market positions in a disruptive technology. In two cases, managers harnessed,
         rather than fought, the forces of resource dependence: They spun out independent companies to commercialize the disruptive
         technology. In the third, the manager chose to fight these forces, and survived the project, exhausted.
