      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_1"><a href="part0014_split_000.html#endnote_reference_1">1.</a> See C. K. Prahalad, and Gary Hamel, “The Core Competence of the Corporation,” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, 1990.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_2"><a href="part0014_split_001.html#endnote_reference_2">2.</a> Many of these ideas emerged from wonderful, stimulating discussions with doctoral students in the Business Policy seminar
         at the Harvard Business School between 1993 and 1999. I wish to thank all of those students, but in particular Don Sull, Tom
         Eisenmann, Tomoyoshi Noda, Michael Raynor, Michael Roberto, Deborah Sole, Clark Gilbert, and Michael Overdorf for their contributions
         to these ideas.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_3"><a href="part0014_split_003.html#endnote_reference_3">3.</a> The most logical, comprehensive characterization of processes that we have seen is in David Garvin, “The Processes of Organization
         and Management,” <em class="calibre2">Sloan Management Review</em>, Summer, 1998. When we use the term “processes,” we mean for it to include all of the types of processes that Garvin has
         defined.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_5"><a href="part0014_split_003.html#endnote_reference_5">5.</a> Professor Leonardi’s work on this topic, in my opinion, constitutes the fundamental paradigm upon which much subsequent
         research is being built. 5. See Wickham Skinner, “The Focused Factory,” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, 1974.

This description of the development of an organization’s culture draws heavily
         from Schein’s research.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_10"><a href="part0014_split_011.html#endnote_reference_10">10.</a> See Kim B. Clark and Steven C. Wheelwright, “Organizing and Leading Heavyweight Development Teams,” <em class="calibre2">California Management Review</em> (34), Spring, 1992, 9–28. The concepts described in this article are extremely important. We highly recommend that managers
         interested in these problems study it thoughtfully. They define a heavyweight team as one in which team members typically
         are dedicated and colocated. The charge of each team member is not to represent their functional group on the team, but to
         act as a <em class="calibre2">general manager</em>—to assume responsibility for the success of the entire project, and to be actively involved in the decisions and work of
         members who come from each functional area. As they work together to complete their project, they will work out new ways of
         interacting, coordinating, and decision-making that will come to comprise the new processes, or new capabilities, that will
         be needed to succeed in the new enterprise on an ongoing basis. These ways of getting work done then get institutionalized
         as the new business or product line grows.
