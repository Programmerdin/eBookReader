<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_5">CASE STUDY: PUSHING THE GROWTH RATE OF AN EMERGING MARKET</h1>
 <p class="p">The history of Apple Computer’s early entry into the hand-held computer, or personal digital assistant (PDA), market helps
  to clarify the difficulties confronting large companies in small markets.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Apple Computer introduced its Apple I in 1976. It was at best a preliminary product with limited functionality, and the company
  sold a total of 200 units at $666 each before withdrawing it from the market. But the Apple I wasn’t a financial disaster.
  Apple had spent modestly on its development, and both Apple and its customers learned a lot about how desktop personal computers
  might be used. Apple incorporated this learning into its Apple II computer, introduced in 1977, which was highly successful.
  Apple sold 43,000 Apple II computers in the first two years they were on the market,
  <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_11">11</a></sup>
  <a id="endnote_reference_11"></a> and the product’s success positioned the company as the leader in the personal computer industry. On the basis of the Apple
  II’s success Apple went public in 1980.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">A decade after the release of the Apple II, Apple Computer had grown into a $5 billion company, and like all large and successful
  companies, it found itself having to add large chunks of revenue each year to preserve its equity value and organizational
  vitality. In the early 1990s, the emerging market for hand-held PDAs presented itself as a potential vehicle for achieving
  that needed growth. In many ways, this opportunity, analogous to that in 1978 when the Apple II computer helped shape its
  industry, was a great fit for Apple. Apple’s distinctive design expertise was in user-friendly products, and user-friendliness
  and convenience were the basis of the PDA concept.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">How did Apple approach this opportunity? Aggressively. It invested scores of millions of dollars to develop its product, dubbed
  the “Newton.” The Newton’s features were defined through one of the most thoroughly executed market research efforts in corporate
  history; focus groups and surveys of every type were used to determine what features consumers 
  <a id="page131"></a>would want. The PDA had many of the characteristics of a disruptive computing technology, and recognizing the potential problems,
  Apple CEO John Sculley made the Newton’s development a personal priority, promoting the product widely, and ensuring that
  the effort got the technical and financial resources it needed.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Apple sold 140,000 Newtons in 1993 and 1994, its first two years on the market. Most observers, of course, viewed the Newton
  as a big flop. Technically, its handwriting recognition capabilities were disappointing, and its wireless communications technologies
  had made it expensive. But what was most damning was that while Sculley had publicly positioned the Newton as a key product
  to sustain the company’s growth, its first-year sales amounted to about 1 percent of Apple’s revenues. Despite all the effort,
  the Newton made hardly a dent in Apple’s need for new growth.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">But was the Newton a failure? The timing of Newton’s entry into the handheld market was akin to the timing of the Apple II
  into the desktop market. It was a market-creating, disruptive product targeted at an undefinable set of users whose needs
  were unknown to either themselves or Apple. On that basis, Newton’s sales should have been a pleasant surprise to Apple’s
  executives: It outsold the Apple II in its first two years by a factor of more than three to one. But while selling 43,000
  units was viewed as an IPO-qualifying triumph in the smaller Apple of 1979, selling 140,000 Newtons was viewed as a failure
  in the giant Apple of 1994.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">As <a href="part0013_split_000.html">chapter 7</a> will show, disruptive technologies often enable something to be done that previously had been deemed impossible.
  Because of this, when they initially emerge, neither manufacturers nor customers know how or why the products will be used,
  and hence do not know what specific features of the product will and will not ultimately be valued. Building such markets
  entails a process of mutual discovery by customers and manufacturers—and this simply takes time. In Apple’s development of
  the desktop computer, for example, the Apple I failed, the first Apple II was lackluster, and the Apple II<sup class="calibre6">[H11501]</sup> succeeded. The Apple III was a market failure because of quality problems, and the Lisa was a failure. The first two generations
  of the Macintosh computer also stumbled. It wasn’t until the third iteration of the Macintosh that Apple and its customers
  finally found “it”: the standard for convenient, user-friendly computing to which the rest of the industry ultimately had
  to conform.
  <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_12">12</a></sup>
  <a id="endnote_reference_12"></a>
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">In launching the Newton, however, Apple was desperate to short-circuit this coalescent process for defining the ultimate product
  and market. It assumed that its customers knew what they wanted and spent very 
  <a id="page132"></a>aggressively to find out what this was. (As the next chapter will show, this is impossible.) Then to give customers what they
  thought they wanted, Apple had to assume the precarious role of a sustaining technology leader in an emerging industry. It
  spent enormous sums to push mobile data communications and handwriting recognition technologies beyond the state of the art.
  And finally, it spent aggressively to convince people to buy what it had designed.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Because emerging markets are small by definition, the organizations competing in them must be able to become profitable at
  small scale. This is crucial because organizations or projects that are perceived as being profitable and successful can continue
  to attract financial and human resources both from their corporate parents and from capital markets. Initiatives perceived
  as failures have a difficult time attracting either. Unfortunately, the scale of the investments Apple made in its Newton
  in order to hasten the emergence of the PDA market made it very difficult to earn an attractive return. Hence, the Newton
  came to be broadly viewed as a flop.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">As with most business disappointments, hindsight reveals the faults in Apple’s Newton project. But I believe that the root
  cause of Apple’s struggle was <em class="calibre2">not</em> inappropriate management. The executives’ actions were a symptom of a deeper problem: Small markets cannot satisfy the near-term
  growth requirements of big organizations.
