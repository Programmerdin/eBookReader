<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_6">DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE THEORY OF RESOURCE DEPENDENCE</h1>
      <p class="p">The struggles recounted earlier of Seagate Technology’s attempts to sell 3.5-inch drives and of Bucyrus Erie’s failed attempt
         to sell its early Hydrohoe only to its mainstream customers illustrate how the theory of resource dependence can be applied
         to cases of disruptive technologies. In both instances, Seagate and Bucyrus were among the first in their 
         <a id="page108"></a>industries to develop these disruptive products. But despite senior managers’ decisions to introduce them, the impetus or
         organizational energy required to launch the products aggressively into the appropriate value networks simply did not coalesce—until
         customers needed them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Should we then accept the corollary stipulated by resource-dependence theorists that managers are merely powerless individuals?
         Hardly. In the Introduction, exploring the image of how people learned to fly, I noted that all attempts had ended in failure
         as long as they consisted of fighting fundamental laws of nature. But once laws such as gravity, Bernoulli’s principle, and
         the notions of lift, drag and resistance began to be understood, and flying machines were designed that accounted for or harnessed
         those laws, people flew quite successfully. By analogy, this is what Quantum and Control Data did. By embedding independent
         organizations within an entirely different value network, where they were dependent upon the appropriate set of customers
         for survival, those managers harnessed the powerful forces of resource dependence. The CEO of Micro-polis fought them, but
         he won a rare and costly victory.

      <p class="calibre5">Disruptive technologies have had deadly impact in many industries besides disk drives, mechanical excavators, and steel.

         <a id="endnote_reference_7"></a> The following pages summarize the effect of disruptive technologies in three other industries— computers, retailing, and
         printers—to highlight how the only companies in those industries that established strong market positions in the disruptive
         technologies were those which, like Quantum and Control Data, harnessed rather than fought the forces of resource dependence.
