<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_7">MINIMILL THIN-SLAB CASTING FOR SHEET STEEL</h1>
      <p class="p">While integrated steel makers were busy engineering their recoveries, more disruptive clouds began gathering on the horizon.
         In 1987, a German supplier of equipment for the steel industry, Schloemann-Siemag AG, announced that it had developed what
         it called “continuous thin-slab casting” technology—a way for steel to be continuously cast from its molten state into long,
         thin slabs that could be transported directly, without cooling, into a rolling mill. Rolling the white-hot, already thin slab
         of steel to the final thickness of coiled sheet steel was much simpler than the traditional task mastered by the integrated
         mills of reheating and rolling sheet from thick ingots or slabs. Most important, a cost-competitive continuous thin-slab casting
         and rolling mill could be built for less than $250 million—one-tenth the capital cost of a traditional sheet mill and a relatively
         manageable investment for a minimill steel maker. At this scale, an electric arc furnace could easily supply the required
         quantity of molten steel. Moreover, thin-slab casting promised at least a 20 percent reduction in the total cost of making
         sheet steel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Because of its promise, thin-slab casting was carefully evaluated by every major player in the steel industry. Some integrated
         mills, such as USX, worked very hard to justify installation of a thin-slab facility.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0009_split_008.html#endnote_text_73">11</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_73"></a> In the end, however, it was minimill Nucor Steel, rather than the integrated mills, that made the bold move into thin-slab
         casting. Why?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">At the outset, thin-slab casting technology could not offer the smooth, defect-free surface finish required by the integrated
         mills’ mainstream customers (makers of cans, cars, and appliances). The only markets were those such as construction decking
         and corrugated steel for culverts, pipes, and Quonset huts, in which users were more sensitive to price than to surface blemishes.
         Thin-slab casting was a disruptive technology. Furthermore, large, capable, and hungry integrated competitors were busy trying
         
         <a id="page93"></a>to rob each other’s most profitable business with the large auto, appliance, and can companies. It made no sense for them
         to target capital investment at thin-slab casting, positioned as it was in the least-profitable, most price-competitive and
         commodity-like end of their business. Indeed, after seriously considering between 1987 and 1988 whether to invest in thin-slab
         casting at an amount then projected to be about $150 million, both Bethlehem and USX elected instead to invest in conventional
         thick-slab continuous casters at a cost of $250 million to protect and enhance the profitability of the business with their
         mainstream customers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Not surprisingly, Nucor saw the situation another way. Unencumbered by the demands of profitable customers in the sheet steel
         business and benefiting from a cost structure forged at the bottom of the industry, Nucor fired up the world’s first continuous
         thin-slab casting facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1989, and constructed a second mill in Hickman, Arkansas, in 1992.
         It increased its capacity at both sites by 80 percent in 1995. Analysts estimate that Nucor had captured 7 percent of the
         massive North American sheet market by 1996—hardly enough to concern the integrated mills, because Nucor’s success has been
         limited to the commoditized, least-profitable end of their product line. Of course, in its effort to win higher-margin business
         with higher-quality products from these mills, Nucor has already improved the surface quality of its sheet steel substantially.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Thus, the integrated steel companies’ march to the profitable northeast corner of the steel industry is a story of aggressive
         investment, rational decision making, close attention to the needs of mainstream customers, and record profits. It is the
         same innovator’s dilemma that confounded the leading providers of disk drives and mechanical excavators: Sound managerial
         decisions are at the very root of their impending fall from industry leadership.
