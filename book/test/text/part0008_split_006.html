<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_6">THE CHOICE BETWEEN CABLE AND HYDRAULICS</h1>
      <p class="p">In the trajectory map of Figure 3.3, when hydraulics technology became capable of addressing the bucket-size needs of sewer
         and piping contractors (and a similar trajectory could be sketched for arm-reach), the competitive dynamics in the industry
         changed, and the mainstream excavation contractors changed the criteria by which they purchased their equipment. Even today,
         the cable-actuated architecture can attain much longer reach and greater lift than can hydraulic excavators: They have roughly
         parallel technology trajectories. But once <em class="calibre2">both</em> cable-and hydraulics-actuated systems could satisfy mainstream market requirements, excavation contractors could no longer
         base their choice of equipment on which had longer reach and greater bucket capacity. Both were good enough, and the fact
         that cable was better ceased to have competitive relevance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Contractors found, however, that hydraulic machines were much less prone to breakdowns than cable-actuated excavators. In
         particular, those who had experienced the life-threatening snap of a cable while hefting a heavy bucket embraced reliable
         hydraulics quickly, as soon as it was capable of doing the job. Once both technologies were good enough in the basic capabilities
         demanded, therefore, the basis of product choice in the market shifted to reliability. Sewer and piping contractors began
         
         <a id="page73"></a>adopting hydraulic equipment rapidly beginning in the early 1960s, and general excavation contractors followed later in the
         decade.
