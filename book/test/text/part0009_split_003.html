<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_3">RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND UPWARD MIGRATION</h1>
      <p class="p">
         <a id="page82"></a>Further insight into this asymmetric mobility across value networks comes from comparing two different descriptive models
         of how resources are allocated. The first model describes resource allocation as a rational, top-down decision-making process
         in which senior managers weigh alternative proposals for investment in innovation and put money into those projects that they
         find to be consistent with firm strategy and to offer the highest return on investment. Proposals that don’t clear these hurdles
         are killed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The second model of resource allocation, first articulated by Joseph Bower,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0009_split_008.html#endnote_text_64">2</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_64"></a> characterizes resource allocation decisions much differently. Bower notes that most proposals to innovate are generated from
         deep within the organization not from the top. As these ideas bubble up from the bottom, the organization’s middle managers
         play a critical but invisible role in screening these projects. These managers can’t package and throw their weight behind
         every idea that passes by; they need to decide which are the best, which are most likely to succeed, and which are most likely
         to be approved, given the corporate financial, competitive, and strategic climate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In most organizations, managers’ careers receive a big boost when they play a key sponsorship role in very successful projects—and
         their careers can be permanently derailed if they have the bad judgment or misfortune to back projects that fail. Middle managers
         aren’t penalized for <em class="calibre2">all</em> failures, of course. Projects that fail because the technologists couldn’t deliver, for example, often are not (necessarily)
         regarded as failures at all, because a lot is learned from the effort and because technology development is generally regarded
         as an unpredictable, probabilistic endeavor. But projects that fail because the <em class="calibre2">market</em> wasn’t there have far more serious implications for managers’ careers. These tend to be much more expensive and public failures.
         They generally occur after the company has made full investments in product design, manufacturing, engineering, marketing,
         and distribution. Hence, middle managers—acting in both their own and the company’s interest—tend to back those projects for
         which market demand seems most assured. They then work to package the proposals for their chosen projects in ways geared to
         win senior management approval. As such, while senior managers may <em class="calibre2">think</em> they’re making the resource allocation decisions, many of the really critical resource allocation decisions have actually
         been made long before senior management gets involved: Middle managers have made their decisions about which projects 
         <a id="page83"></a>they’ll back and carry to senior management—and which they will allow to languish.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Consider the implications of this for a successful firm’s downward and upward mobility from its initial value network in this
         hypothetical example. In the same week, two respected employees, one from marketing, the other from engineering, run two very
         different ideas for new products past their common manager two levels above them in the organization. The marketer comes first,
         with an idea for a higher-capacity, higher-speed model. The two-levels-up manager starts her interrogation:
      </p>
      <p class="ext">“Who’s going to buy it?”</p>
      <p class="ext1">“Well, there’s a whole segment in the workstation industry—they buy over $600 million in drives each year—that we’ve just
         never been able to reach because our capacity points just don’t reach that high. I think this product just might get us there.”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">“Have you run this idea past any potential customers?”</p>
      <p class="ext1">“Yeah, I was in California last week. They all said they wanted prototypes as soon as they could get them. There’s a design
         window opening up in nine months. They’ve been working with their current supplier [competitor X] to get something ready,
         but someone we just hired from competitor X said they’re having lots of trouble meeting the specs. I really think we can do
         it.”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">“But does <em class="calibre2">engineering</em> think we can do it?”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">“They say it’ll be a stretch, but you know them. They always say that.” “What kind of margins are we looking at up there?”</p>
      <p class="ext1">“That’s what really excites me about this. If we can build it in our current factory, given the price per megabyte competitor
         X has been getting, I think we can get close to 35 percent.”
      </p>
      <p class="spb">Compare that conversation to the manager’s interchange with the engineer whose idea is for a cheaper, smaller, slower, lower-capacity
         disruptive disk drive.
      </p>
      <p class="ext">“Who’s going to buy it?”</p>
      <p class="ext1">“Well, I’m not sure, but there’s <em class="calibre2">got</em> to be a market out there <em class="calibre2">somewhere</em> for it. People are always wanting things smaller and less expensive. I could see them using it in fax machines, printers,
         maybe.”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">“Have you run this idea past any potential customers?”</p>
      <p class="ext1">“Yeah, when I was at the last trade show I sketched the idea out for one of our current customers. He said he was interested,
         but couldn’t see how they could really use it. Today you really need 270 MB to run everything, and there’s just no way we
         could get that kind of capacity on this thing—at least not for a while. His response doesn’t surprise me, really.”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">
         <a id="page84"></a>“How about the guys who make fax machines? What do they think?”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">“Well, they say they don’t know. Again, it’s an intriguing idea, but they already have their product plans pretty well set,
         and none of them use disk drives.”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">“You think we could make money on this project?”</p>
      <p class="ext1">“Well, I think so, but that depends on how we could price it, of course.”</p>
      <p class="spb">Which of the two projects will the two-levels-up manager back? In the tug-of-war for development resources, projects targeted
         at the explicit needs of current customers or at the needs of existing users that a supplier has not yet been able to reach
         will <em class="calibre2">always</em> win over proposals to develop products for markets that do not exist. This is because, in fact, the best resource allocation
         systems are designed precisely to weed out ideas that are unlikely to find large, profitable, receptive markets. Any company
         that <em class="calibre2">doesn’t</em> have a systematic way of targeting its development resources toward customers’ needs, in fact, will fail.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0009_split_008.html#endnote_text_65">3</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_65"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The most vexing managerial aspect of this problem of asymmetry, where the easiest path to growth and profit is up, and the
         most deadly attacks come from below, is that “good” management—working harder and smarter and being more visionary—doesn’t
         solve the problem. The resource allocation process involves thousands of decisions, some subtle and some explicit, made every
         day by hundreds of people, about how their time and the company’s money ought to be spent. Even when a senior manager decides
         to pursue a disruptive technology, the people in the organization are likely to ignore it or, at best, cooperate reluctantly
         if it doesn’t fit <em class="calibre2">their</em> model of what it takes to succeed as an organization and as individuals within an organization. Well-run companies are not
         populated by yes-people who have been taught to carry out mindlessly the directives of management. Rather, their employees
         have been trained to understand what is good for the company and what it takes to build a successful career within the company.
         Employees of great companies exercise initiative to serve customers and meet budgeted sales and profits. It is very difficult
         for a manager to motivate competent people to energetically and persistently pursue a course of action that they think makes
         no sense. An example from the history of the disk drive industry illustrates the impact of such employee behavior.
