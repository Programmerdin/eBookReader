      <p class="p">
         <a id="page191"></a>The relation between disruptive technologies and the basis of competition in an industry is complex. In the interplay among
         performance oversupply, the product life cycle, and the emergence of disruptive technologies, it is often the very attributes
         that render disruptive technologies useless in mainstream markets that constitute their value in new markets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In general, companies that have succeeded in disruptive innovation initially took the characteristics and capabilities of
         the technology for granted and sought to find or create a new market that would value or accept those attributes. Thus, Conner
         Peripherals created a market for small drives in portable computers, where smallness was valued; J. C. Bamford and J. I. Case
         built a market for excavators among residential contractors, where small buckets and tractor mobility actually created value;
         and Nucor found a market that didn’t mind the surface blemishes on its thin-slab-cast sheet steel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The companies toppled by these disruptive technologies, in contrast, each took the established market’s <em class="calibre2">needs</em> as given, and did not attempt to market the technology until they felt it was good enough to be valued in the mainstream
         market. Thus, Seagate’s marketers took the firm’s early 3.5-inch drives to IBM for evaluation, rather than asking, “Where
         is the market that would actually value a smaller, lower-capacity drive?” When Bucyrus Erie acquired its Hydrohoe hydraulic
         excavator line in 1951, its managers apparently did not ask, “Where is the market that actually <em class="calibre2">wants</em> a mobile excavator that can only dig narrow trenches?” They assumed instead that the market needed the largest possible bucket
         size and the longest possible reach; they jury-rigged the Hydrohoe with cables, pulleys, clutches, and winches and attempted
         to sell it to general excavation contractors. When U.S. Steel was evaluating continuous thin-slab casting, they did not ask,
         “Where is the market for low-priced sheet steel with poor surface appearance?” Rather, they took it for granted that the market
         needed the highest-possible quality of surface finish and invested more capital in a conventional caster. They applied to
         a disruptive innovation a way of thinking appropriate to a sustaining technology.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In the instances studied in this book, established firms confronted with disruptive technology typically viewed their primary
         development challenge as a <em class="calibre2">technological</em> one: to improve the disruptive technology enough that it suits known markets. In contrast, the firms that were most successful
         in commercializing a disruptive technology were those framing their primary 
         <a id="page192"></a>development challenge as a <em class="calibre2">marketing</em> one: to build or find a market where product competition occurred along dimensions that favored the disruptive attributes
         of the product.

         <a id="endnote_reference_4"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">It is critical that managers confronting disruptive technology observe this principle. If history is any guide, companies
         that keep disruptive technologies bottled up in their labs, working to improve them until they suit mainstream markets, will
         not be nearly as successful as firms that find markets that embrace the attributes of disruptive technologies as they initially
         stand. These latter firms, by creating a commercial base and then moving upmarket, will ultimately address the mainstream
         market much more effectively than will firms that have framed disruptive technology as a laboratory, rather than a marketing,
         challenge.
