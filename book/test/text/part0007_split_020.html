<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_20">IMPLICATIONS OF THE VALUE NETWORK FRAMEWORK FOR INNOVATION</h1>
      <p class="p">Value networks strongly define and delimit what companies within them can and cannot do. This chapter closes with five propositions
         about the 
         <a id="page54"></a>nature of technological change and the problems successful incumbent firms encounter, which the value network perspective
         highlights.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">1. The context, or value network, in which a firm competes has a profound influence on its ability to marshal and focus the
         necessary resources and capabilities to overcome the technological and organizational hurdles that impede innovation. The
         boundaries of a value network are determined by a unique definition of product performance—a rank-ordering of the importance
         of various performance attributes differing markedly from that employed in other systems-of-use in a broadly defined industry.
         Value networks are also defined by particular cost structures inherent in addressing customers’ needs within the network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">2. A key determinant of the probability of an innovative effort’s commercial success is the degree to which it addresses the
         well-understood needs of known actors within the value network. Incumbent firms are likely to lead their industries in innovations
         of all sorts—architecture and components—that address needs within their value network, regardless of intrinsic technological
         character or difficulty. These are straightforward innovations; their value and application are clear. Conversely, incumbent
         firms are likely to lag in the development of technologies—even those in which the technology involved is intrinsically simple—that
         only address customers’ needs in emerging value networks. Disruptive innovations are complex because their value and application
         are uncertain, according to the criteria used by incumbent firms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">3. Established firms’ decisions to ignore technologies that do not address their customers’ needs become fatal when two distinct
         trajectories interact. The first defines the performance demanded over time within a given value network, and the second traces
         the performance that technologists are able to provide within a given technological paradigm. The trajectory of performance
         improvement that technology is able to provide may have a distinctly different slope from the trajectory of performance improvement
         demanded in the system-of-use by downstream customers within any given value network. When the slopes of these two trajectories
         are similar, we expect the technology to remain relatively contained within its initial value network. But when the slopes
         differ, new technologies that are initially performance-competitive only within emerging or commercially remote value networks
         may migrate into other networks, providing a vehicle for innovators in new networks to attack established ones. When such
         an attack occurs, it is because technological progress has diminished the relevance of differences in the rank-ordering of
         performance attributes 
         <a id="page55"></a>across different value networks. For example, the disk drive attributes of size and weight were far more important in the
         desktop computing value network than they were in the mainframe and minicomputer value networks. When technological progress
         in 5.25-inch drives enabled manufacturers to satisfy the attribute prioritization in the mainframe and minicomputer networks,
         which prized total capacity and high speed, <em class="calibre2">as well as</em> that in the desktop network, the boundaries between the value networks ceased to be barriers to entry for 5.25-inch drive
         makers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">4. Entrant firms have an attacker’s advantage over established firms in those innovations—generally new product architectures
         involving little new technology per se—that disrupt or redefine the level, rate, and direction of progress in an established
         technological trajectory. This is so because such technologies generate no value within the established network. The only
         way established firms can lead in commercializing such technologies is to enter the value network in which they create value.
         As Richard Tedlow noted in his history of retailing in America (in which supermarkets and discount retailing play the role
         of disruptive technologies), “the most formidable barrier the established firms faced is that they did not want to do this.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_48">25</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_48"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">5. In these instances, although this “attacker’s advantage” is <em class="calibre2">associated</em> with a disruptive technology change, the essence of the attacker’s advantage is in the ease with which entrants, relative
         to incumbents, can identify and make strategic commitments to attack and develop emerging market applications, or value networks.
         At its core, therefore, the issue may be the relative flexibility of successful established firms versus entrant firms to
         change <em class="calibre2">strategies and cost structures</em>, not technologies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">These propositions provide new dimensions for analyzing technological innovation. In addition to the required capabilities
         inherent in new technologies and in the innovating organization, firms faced with disruptive technologies must examine the
         implications of innovation for their relevant value networks. The key considerations are whether the performance attributes
         implicit in the innovation will be valued within the networks already served by the innovator; whether other networks must
         be addressed or new ones created in order to realize value for the innovation; and whether market and technological trajectories
         may eventually intersect, carrying technologies that do not address customers’ needs today to squarely address their needs
         in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">These considerations apply not simply to firms grappling with the most modern technologies, such as the fast-paced, complex
         advanced electronic, 
         <a id="page56"></a>mechanical, and magnetics technologies covered in this chapter. <a href="part0008_split_000.html">Chapter 3</a> examines them in the context of a very different
         industry: earthmoving equipment.
