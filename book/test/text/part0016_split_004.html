<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_4"><em class="calibre2">How Are Today’s Automobile Companies Marketing Electric Vehicles?</em></h2>
      <p class="p">The strategy proposed here for finding and defining the initial market for electric vehicles stands in stark contrast to the
         marketing approaches being used by today’s major automakers, each of which is struggling to sell 
         <a id="page212"></a>electric vehicles into its mainstream market in the time-honored tradition of established firms mishandling disruptive technologies.
         Consider this statement made in 1995 by William Glaub, Chrysler general sales manager, discussing his company’s planned offering
         for 1998.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_11">11</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_11"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="ext">Chrysler Corporation is preparing to provide an electric powered version of our slick new minivan in time for the 1998 model
         year. After an in-depth study of the option between a purpose-built vehicle and modification of an existing platform, the
         choice of the minivan to use as an electric powered platform, in retrospect, is an obvious best choice for us. Our experience
         shows that fleets will likely be the best opportunity to move any number of these vehicles …. The problem that we face is
         <em class="calibre2">not</em> in creating an attractive package. The new minivan is an attractive package. The problem is that sufficient energy storage
         capacity is not available on board the vehicle.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_12">12</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_12"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="spb">To position its offering in the mainstream market, Chrysler has had to pack its minivan with 1,600 <em class="calibre2">pounds</em> of batteries. This, of course, makes its acceleration much slower, its driving range shorter, and its braking distance longer
         than other available gasoline-powered automobiles. Because of the way Chrysler has positioned its electric vehicle, industry
         analysts naturally compare it to gasoline-powered minivans, using the metrics paramount in the mainstream value network. At
         an estimated cost of $100,000 (compared with $22,000 for the gasoline-powered model), nobody in their right mind would consider
         buying Chrysler’s product.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Chrysler’s marketers are, naturally enough, very pessimistic about their ability to sell <em class="calibre2">any</em> electric minivans in California, despite the government’s mandate that they do so. William Glaub, for example, continued
         the remarks cited above with the following observation:
      </p>
      <p class="ext">Markets are developed with fine products that customers desire to own. No salesman can take marginal product into the marketplace
         and have any hope of establishing a sustainable consumer base. Consumers will not be forced into a purchase that they do not
         want. Mandates will not work in a consumer-driven, free market economy. For electric vehicles to find a place in the market,
         respectable products comparable to today’s gasoline-powered cars must be available.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_13">13</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_13"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="spb">Chrysler’s conclusion is absolutely correct, given the way its marketers have framed their challenge.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_14">14</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_14"></a> Mainstream customers can <em class="calibre2">never</em> use a disruptive technology at its outset.
