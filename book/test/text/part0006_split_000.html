         <a id="page3"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> When I began my search for an answer to the puzzle of why the best firms can fail, a friend offered some sage advice. “Those
         who study genetics avoid studying humans,” he noted. “Because new generations come along only every thirty years or so, it
         takes a long time to understand the cause and effect of any changes. Instead, they study fruit flies, because they are conceived,
         born, mature, and die all within a single day. If you want to understand why something happens in business, study the disk
         drive industry. Those companies are the closest things to fruit flies that the business world will ever see.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Indeed, nowhere in the history of business has there been an industry like disk drives, where changes in technology, market
         structure, global scope, and vertical integration have been so pervasive, rapid, and unrelenting. While this pace and complexity
         might be a nightmare for managers, my friend was right about its being fertile ground for research. Few industries offer researchers
         the same opportunities for developing theories about how different types of change cause certain types of firms to succeed
         or fail or for testing those theories as the industry repeats its cycles of change.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This chapter summarizes the history of the disk drive industry in all its complexity. Some readers will be interested in it
         for the sake of history itself. <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0006_split_012.html#endnote_text_8">1</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_8"></a> But the value of understanding this history is that out of its complexity 
         <a id="page4"></a>emerge a few stunningly simple and consistent factors that have repeatedly determined the success and failure of the industry’s
         best firms. Simply put, when the best firms succeeded, they did so because they listened responsively to their customers and
         invested aggressively in the technology, products, and manufacturing capabilities that satisfied their customers’ next-generation
         needs. But, paradoxically, when the best firms subsequently failed, it was for the same reasons—they listened responsively
         to their customers and invested aggressively in the technology, products, and manufacturing capabilities that satisfied their
         customers’ next-generation needs. This is one of the innovator’s dilemmas: Blindly following the maxim that good managers
         should keep close to their customers can sometimes be a fatal mistake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The history of the disk drive industry provides a framework for understanding when “keeping close to your customers” is good
         advice—and when it is not. The robustness of this framework could only be explored by researching the industry’s history in
         careful detail. Some of that detail is recounted here, and elsewhere in this book, in the hope that readers who are immersed
         in the detail of their own industries will be better able to recognize how similar patterns have affected their own fortunes
         and those of their competitors.
