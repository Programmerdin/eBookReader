      <p class="p">Disruptive technologies typically enable new markets to emerge. There is strong evidence showing that companies entering these
         emerging markets early have significant first-mover advantages over later entrants. And yet, as these companies succeed and
         grow larger, it becomes progressively more difficult for them to enter the even newer small markets destined to become the
         large ones of the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">To maintain their share prices and create internal opportunities for employees to extend the scope of their responsibilities,
         successful companies need to continue to grow. But while a $40 million company needs to find just $8 million in revenues to
         grow at 20 percent in the subsequent year, a $4 billion company needs to find $800 million in new sales. No new 
         <a id="pagexxi"></a>markets are that large. As a consequence, the larger and more successful an organization becomes, the weaker the argument
         that emerging markets can remain useful engines for growth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Many large companies adopt a strategy of waiting until new markets are “large enough to be interesting.” But the evidence
         presented in <a href="part0012_split_000.html">chapter 6</a> shows why this is not often a successful strategy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Those large established firms that have successfully seized strong positions in the new markets enabled by disruptive technologies
         have done so by giving responsibility to commercialize the disruptive technology to an organization whose size matched the
         size of the targeted market. Small organizations can most easily respond to the opportunities for growth in a small market.
         The evidence is strong that formal and informal resource allocation processes make it very difficult for large organizations
         to focus adequate energy and talent on small markets, even when logic says they might be big someday.
