         <a id="page77"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> It is clear from the histories of the disk drive and excavator industries that the boundaries of value networks do not completely
         imprison the companies within them: There is considerable <em class="calibre2">upward</em> mobility into other networks. It is in restraining <em class="calibre2">downward</em> mobility into the markets enabled by disruptive technologies that the value networks exercise such unusual power. In this
         chapter we will explore these questions: Why could leading companies migrate so readily toward high-end markets, and why does
         moving downmarket appear to have been so difficult? Rational managers, as we shall see, can rarely build a cogent case for
         entering small, poorly defined low-end markets that offer only lower profitability. In fact, the prospects for growth and
         improved profitability in upmarket value networks often appear to be so much more attractive than the prospect of staying
         within the <em class="calibre2">current</em> value network, that it is not unusual to see well-managed companies leaving (or becoming uncompetitive with) their original
         customers as they search for customers at higher price points. In good companies, resources and energy coalesce most readily
         behind proposals to attack upmarket into higher-performance products that can earn higher margins.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Indeed, the prospects for improving financial performance by moving toward upmarket value networks are so strong that one
         senses a huge 
         <a id="page78"></a>magnet in the northeast corner of the disk drive and excavator trajectory maps. This chapter examines the power of this “northeastern
         pull” by looking at evidence from the history of the disk drive industry. It then generalizes this framework by exploring
         the same phenomenon in the battle between minimill and integrated steel makers.
