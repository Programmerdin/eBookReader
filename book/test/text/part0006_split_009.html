<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_9"><em class="calibre2">Prairietek, Conner, and the 2.5-inch Drive</em></h2>
      <p class="p">In 1989 an industry entrant in Longmont, Colorado, Prairietek, upstaged the industry by announcing a 2.5-inch drive, capturing
         nearly all $30 million of this nascent market. But Conner Peripherals announced its own 2.5-inch product in early 1990 and
         by the end of that year had claimed 95 percent of the 2.5-inch drive market. Prairietek declared bankruptcy in late 1991,
         by which time each of the other 3.5-inch drivemakers— Quantum, Seagate, Western Digital, and Maxtor—had introduced 2.5-inch
         drives of their own.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">What had changed? Had the incumbent leading firms finally learned the lessons of history? Not really. Although Figure 1.7
         shows the 2.5-inch drive had significantly less capacity than the 3.5-inch drives, the portable computing markets into which
         the smaller drives were sold valued <em class="calibre2">other</em> attributes: weight, ruggedness, low power consumption, small physical size, and so on. Along <em class="calibre2">these</em> dimensions, the 2.5-inch drive offered improved performance over that of the 3.5-inch product: It was a <em class="calibre2">sustaining</em> technology. In fact, the computer makers who bought Conner’s 3.5-inch drive—laptop computer manufacturers such as Toshiba,
         Zenith, and Sharp—were the leading makers of notebook computers, and these firms needed the smaller 2.5-inch drive architecture.
         Hence, Conner and its competitors in the 3.5-inch market followed their customers seamlessly across the transition to 2.5-inch
         drives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In 1992, however, the 1.8-inch drive emerged, with a distinctly disruptive character. Although its story will be recounted
         in detail later, it suffices to state here that by 1995, it was <em class="calibre2">entrant</em> firms that controlled 98 percent of the $130 million 1.8-inch drive market. Moreover, the largest initial market for 1.8-inch
         drives wasn’t in computing at all. It was in portable heart monitoring devices!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Figure 1.8 summarizes this pattern of entrant firms’ leadership in disruptive technology. It shows, for example, that two
         years after the 8-inch drive was introduced, two-thirds of the firms producing it (four of six), were entrants. And, two years
         after the first 5.25-inch drive was introduced, 80 percent of the firms producing these disruptive drives were entrants.
