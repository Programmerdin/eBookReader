      <p class="p">In most companies, however, individual managers don’t have the luxury of surviving a string of trials and errors in pursuit
         of the strategy that works. Rightly or wrongly, individual managers in most organizations believe that they <em class="calibre2">cannot</em> fail: If they champion a project that fails because the initial marketing plan was wrong, it will constitute a blotch on
         their 
         <a id="page156"></a>track record, blocking their rise through the organization. Because failure is intrinsic to the process of finding new markets
         for disruptive technologies, the inability or unwillingness of individual managers to put their careers at risk acts as a
         powerful deterrent to the movement of established firms into the value networks created by those technologies. As Joseph Bower
         observed in his classic study of the resource allocation process at a major chemical company, “Pressure from the market reduces
         both the probability and the cost of being wrong.

         <a id="endnote_reference_10"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Bower’s observation is consistent with the findings in this book about the disk drive industry. When demand for an innovation
         was assured, as was the case with sustaining technologies, the industry’s established leaders were capable of placing huge,
         long, and risky bets to develop whatever technology was required. When demand was not assured, as was the case in disruptive
         technologies, the established firms could not even make the technologically straightforward bets required to commercialize
         such innovations. That is why 65 percent of the companies entering the disk drive industry attempted to do so in an established,
         rather than emerging market. Discovering markets for emerging technologies inherently involves failure, and most individual
         decision makers find it very difficult to risk backing a project that might fail because the market is not there.
