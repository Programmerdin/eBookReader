<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_9"><em class="calibre2">Creating Capabilities Through Acquisitions</em></h2>
      <p class="p">Managers often sense that acquiring rather than developing a set of capabilities makes competitive and financial sense. The
         RPV model can be a useful way to frame the challenge of integrating acquired organizations. Acquiring managers need to begin
         by asking, “What is it that really created the value that I just paid so dearly for? Did I justify the price because of its
         resources—its people, products, technology, market position, and so on? Or, was a substantial portion of its worth created
         by processes and values—unique ways of working and decision-making that have enabled the company to understand and satisfy
         customers, and develop, make, and deliver new products and services in a timely way?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">If the acquired company’s processes and values are the real driver of its success, then the last thing the acquiring manager
         wants to do is to integrate the company into the new parent organization. Integration will vaporize many of the processes
         and values of the acquired firm as its managers are required to adopt the buyer’s way of doing business and have their proposals
         to innovate evaluated according to the decision criteria of the acquiring company. If the acquiree’s processes and values
         were the reason for its historical success, a better strategy is to let the business stand alone, and for the parent to infuse
         its resources into the acquired firm’s processes and values. This strategy, in essence, truly constitutes the acquisition
         of new capabilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">If, on the other hand, the company’s <em class="calibre2">resources</em> were the primary rationale for the acquisition, then integrating the firm into the parent can 
         <a id="page173"></a>make a lot of sense—essentially plugging the acquired people, products, technology, and customers into the parent’s processes,
         as a way of leveraging the parent’s existing capabilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The perils of the DaimlerChrysler merger that began in the late 1990s, for example, can be better understood through the RPV
         model. Chrysler had few resources that could be considered unique in comparison to its competitors. Its success in the market
         of the 1990s was rooted in its processes—particularly in its rapid, creative product design processes, and in its processes
         of integrating the efforts of its subsystem suppliers. What would be the best way for Daimler to leverage the capabilities
         that Chrysler brought to the table? Wall Street exerted nearly inexorable pressure on management to consolidate the two organizations
         in order to cut costs. However, integrating the two companies would likely vaporize the key processes that made Chrysler such
         an attractive acquisition in the first place.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This situation is reminiscent of IBM’s 1984 acquisition of Rolm. There wasn’t anything in Rolm’s pool of resources that IBM
         didn’t already have. It was Rolm’s processes for developing PBX products and for finding new markets for them that was really
         responsible for its success. In 1987 IBM decided to fully integrate the company into its corporate structure. Trying to push
         Rolm’s resources—its products and its customers—through the same processes that were honed in its large computer business,
         caused the Rolm business to stumble badly. And inviting executives of a computer company whose values had been whetted on
         operating profit margins of 18 percent to get excited about prioritizing products with operating margins below 10 percent
         was impossible. IBM’s decision to integrate Rolm actually destroyed the very source of the original worth of the deal. As
         this chapter is being written in February 2000, DaimlerChrysler, bowing to the investment community’s drumbeat for efficiency
         savings, now stands on the edge of the same precipice.

      <p class="calibre5">Often, it seems, financial analysts have a better intuition for the value of resources than for processes.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">In contrast, Cisco Systems’ acquisitions process has worked well— because its managers seem to have kept resources, processes,
         and values in the right perspective. Between 1993 and 1997 it acquired primarily small companies that were less than two years
         old: early-stage organizations whose market value was built primarily upon their resources— particularly engineers and products.
         Cisco has a well-defined, deliberate process by which it essentially plugs these resources into the parent’s 
         <a id="page174"></a>processes and systems, and it has a carefully cultivated method of keeping the engineers of the acquired company happily on
         the Cisco payroll. In the process of integration, Cisco throws away whatever nascent processes and values came with the acquisition—because
         those weren’t what Cisco paid for. On a couple of occasions when the company acquired a larger, more mature organization—notably
         its 1996 acquisition of StrataCom— Cisco did <em class="calibre2">not</em> integrate. Rather, it let StrataCom stand alone, and infused its substantial resources into the organization to help it grow
         at a more rapid rate.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">On at least three occasions, Johnson &amp; Johnson has used acquisitions to establish a position in an important wave of disruptive
         technology. Its businesses in disposable contact lenses, endoscopic surgery, and diabetes blood glucose meters were all acquired
         when they were small, were allowed to stand alone, and were infused with resources. Each has become a billion-dollar business.
         Lucent Technologies and Nortel followed a similar strategy for catching the wave of routers, based upon packet-switching technology,
         that were disrupting their traditional circuit-switching equipment. But they made these acquisitions late and the firms they
         acquired, Ascend Communications and Bay Networks, respectively, were extraordinarily expensive because they had already created
         the new market application, data networks, along with the much larger Cisco Systems—and they were right on the verge of attacking
         the voice network.
