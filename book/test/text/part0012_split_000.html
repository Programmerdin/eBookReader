  <a id="page121"></a> <img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/>Managers who confront disruptive technological change must be leaders, not followers, in commercializing disruptive technologies.
  Doing so requires implanting the projects that are to develop such technologies in commercial organizations that match in
  size the market they are to address. These assertions are based on two key findings of this study: that leadership is more
  crucial in coping with disruptive technologies than with sustaining ones, and that small, emerging markets cannot solve the
  near-term growth and profit requirements of large companies.

 <p class="calibre5">The evidence from the disk drive industry shows that creating new markets is significantly <em class="calibre2">less</em> risky and <em class="calibre2">more</em> rewarding than entering established markets against entrenched competition. But as companies become larger and more successful,
  it becomes even more difficult to enter emerging markets early enough. Because growing companies need to add increasingly
  large chunks of new revenue each year just to maintain their desired rate of growth, it becomes less and less possible that
  small markets can be viable as vehicles through which to find these chunks of revenue. As we shall see, the most straightforward
  way of confronting this difficulty is to implant projects aimed at commercializing disruptive technologies in organizations
  small enough to get excited about small-market opportunities, and to do so on a regular basis even while the mainstream company
  is growing.
