      <p class="p">The technology S-curve is often used to predict whether an emerging technology is likely to supplant an established one. The
         operative trigger is the slope of the curve of the established technology. If the curve has passed its point of inflection,
         so that its second derivative is negative (the technology is improving at a decreasing rate), then a new technology may emerge
         to supplant the established one. Figure 2.7 shows that the S-curve for magnetic disk recording still has not hit its point
         of inflection: Not only is the areal density improving, as of 1995, it was improving at an <em class="calibre2">increasing</em> rate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The S-curve framework would lead us to predict, therefore, that whether or not established disk drive companies possess the
         capability to design flash cards, flash memory will not pose a threat to them until the magnetic memory S-curve has passed
         its point of inflection and the rate of improvement in density begins to decline.
