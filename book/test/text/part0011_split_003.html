      <p class="p">As we have seen, Quantum Corporation, a leading maker of 8-inch drives sold in the minicomputer market in the early 1980s,
         completely missed the advent of 5.25-inch drives: It introduced its first versions nearly four years after those drives first
         appeared in the market. As the 5.25-inch pioneers began to invade the minicomputer market from below, for all the reasons
         already described, Quantum’s sales began to sag.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In 1984 several Quantum employees saw a potential market for a thin 3.5-inch drive plugged into an expansion slot in IBM XT-and
         AT-class desktop computers—drives that would be sold to personal computer users rather than the OEM minicomputer manufacturers
         that had accounted for all of Quantum’s revenue. They determined to leave Quantum and start a new firm to commercialize their
         idea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page105"></a>Rather than let them leave unencumbered, however, Quantum’s executives financed and retained 80 percent ownership of this
         spinoff venture, called Plus Development Corporation, and set the company up in different facilities. It was a completely
         self-sufficient organization, with its own executive staff and all of the functional capabilities required in an independent
         company. Plus was extremely successful. It designed and marketed its drives but had them manufactured under contract by Matsushita
         Kotobuki Electronics (MKE) in Japan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As sales of Quantum’s line of 8-inch drives began to evaporate in the mid-1980s, they were offset by Plus’s growing “Hardcard”
         revenues. By 1987, sales of Quantum’s 8-and 5.25-inch products had largely disappeared. Quantum then purchased the remaining
         20 percent of Plus, essentially closed down the old corporation, and installed Plus’s executives in Quantum’s most senior
         positions. They then reconfigured Plus’s 3.5-inch products to appeal to OEM desktop computer makers, such as Apple, just as
         the capacity vector for 3.5-inch drives was invading the desktop market, as shown in the disk drive trajectory map in Figure
         1.7. Quantum, thus reconstituted as a 3.5-inch drive maker, has aggressively adopted sustaining component technology innovations,
         moving upmarket toward engineering workstations, and has also successfully negotiated the sustaining architectural innovation
         into 2.5-inch drives. By 1994 the new Quantum had become the largest unit-volume producer of disk drives in the world.
