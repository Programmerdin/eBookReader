      <p class="p">When performance oversupply has occurred and a disruptive technology attacks the underbelly of a mainstream market, the disruptive
         technology often succeeds both because it satisfies the market’s need for functionality, in terms of the buying hierarchy,
         and because it is simpler, cheaper, and more reliable and convenient than mainstream products. Recall, for example, the attack
         of hydraulic excavation technology into the mainstream sewer and general excavation markets recounted in <a href="part0008_split_000.html">chapter 3</a>. Once hydraulically
         powered excavators had the strength to handle buckets of 2 to 4 cubic yards of earth (surpassing the performance demanded
         in mainstream markets), contractors rapidly switched to these products even though the cable-actuated machines were capable
         of moving even more earth per scoop. Because both technologies provided adequate bucket capacity for their needs, contractors
         opted for the technology that was most reliable: hydraulics.

      <p class="calibre5">Because established companies are so prone to push for high-performance, high-profit products and markets, they find it very
         difficult not to overload their first disruptive products with features and functionality. Hewlett-Packard’s experience in
         designing its 1.3-inch Kittyhawk disk drive teaches just this lesson. Unable to design a product that was truly simple and
         cheap, Kittyhawk’s champions pushed its capacity to the limits of technology and gave it levels of shock resistance and power
         consumption that would make it competitive as a sustaining product. When very 
         <a id="page193"></a>high volume applications for a cheap, simple, single-function, 10 MB drive began to emerge, HP’s product was not disruptive
         enough to catch that wave. Apple committed a similar error in stretching the functionality of its Newton, instead of initially
         targeting simplicity and reliability.
