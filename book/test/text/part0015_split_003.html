<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_3">PERFORMANCE OVERSUPPLY AND THE EVOLUTION OF PRODUCT COMPETITION</h1>
      <p class="p">
         <a id="page189"></a>The marketing literature provides numerous descriptions of the product life cycle and of the ways in which the characteristics
         of products within given categories evolve over time.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0015_split_011.html#endnote_text_2">2</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_2"></a> The findings in this book suggest that, for many of these models, performance oversupply is an important factor driving the
         transition from one phase of the cycle to the next.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Consider, for example, the product evolution model, called the <em class="calibre2">buying hierarchy</em> by its creators, Windermere Associates of San Francisco, California, which describes as typical the following four phases:
         functionality, reliability, convenience, and price. Initially, when no available product satisfies the functionality requirements
         the market, the basis of competition, or the criteria by which product choice is made, tends to be product <em class="calibre2">functionality.</em> (Sometimes, as in disk drives, a market may cycle through several different functionality dimensions.) Once two or more products
         credibly satisfy the market’s demand for functionality, however, customers can no longer base their choice of products on
         functionality, but tend to choose a product and vendor based on <em class="calibre2">reliability.</em> As long as market demand for reliability exceeds what vendors are able to provide, customers choose products on this basis—and
         the most reliable vendors of the most reliable products earn a premium for it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">But when two or more vendors improve to the point that they more than satisfy the reliability demanded by the market, the
         basis of competition shifts to <em class="calibre2">convenience.</em> Customers will prefer those products that are the most convenient to use and those vendors that are most convenient to deal
         with. Again, as long as the market demand for convenience exceeds what vendors are able to provide, customers choose products
         on this basis 
         <a id="page190"></a>and reward vendors with premium prices for the convenience they offer. Finally, when multiple vendors offer a package of convenient
         products and services that fully satisfies market demand, the basis of competition shifts to <em class="calibre2">price.</em> The factor driving the transition from one phase of the buying hierarchy to the next is performance oversupply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Another useful conception of industry evolution, formulated by Geoffrey Moore in his book <em class="calibre2">Crossing the Chasm</em>,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0015_split_011.html#endnote_text_3">3</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_3"></a> has a similar underlying logic, but articulates the stages in terms of the user rather than the product. Moore suggests that
         products are initially used by innovators and <em class="calibre2">early adopters</em> in an industry—customers who base their choice solely on the product’s functionality. During this phase the top-performing
         products command significant price premiums. Moore observes that markets then expand dramatically after the demand for functionality
         in the mainstream market has been met, and vendors begin to address the need for reliability among what he terms <em class="calibre2">early majority</em> customers. A third wave of growth occurs when product and vendor reliability issues have been resolved, and the basis of
         innovation and competition shifts to convenience, thus pulling in the <em class="calibre2">late majority</em> customers. Underlying Moore’s model is the notion that technology can improve to the point that market demand for a given
         dimension of performance can be satiated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This evolving pattern in the basis of competition—from functionality, to reliability and convenience, and finally to price—has
         been seen in many of the markets so far discussed. In fact, a key characteristic of a disruptive technology is that it heralds
         a change in the basis of competition.
