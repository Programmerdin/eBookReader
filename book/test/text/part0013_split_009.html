         School, Case No. 9-697-060, 1996.

         Industry—1975,” No. 9-578-210, and a report published by The Boston Consulting Group, “Strategy Alternatives for the British
         Motorcycle Industry,” 1975.

         Memories: A Process Theory of Strategic Business Exit in Dynamic Environments,” <em class="calibre2">Administrative Science Quarterly</em> (39), 1994, 24–56. This thoroughly researched and compellingly written study of the process of strategy evolution is well
         worth reading.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_8"><a href="part0013_split_005.html#endnote_reference_8">8.</a> Studies of how managers define and perceive risk can shed significant light on this puzzle. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman,
         for example, have shown that people tend to regard propositions that they do not understand as more risky, regardless of their
         intrinsic risk, and to regard things they <em class="calibre2">do</em> understand as <em class="calibre2">less</em> risky, again without regard to intrinsic risk. (Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics
         and Biases,” <em class="calibre2">Science</em> [185], 1974, 1124–1131.) Managers, therefore, may view creation 
         <a id="page159"></a>of new markets as risky propositions, in the face of contrary evidence, because they do not understand non-existent markets;
         similarly, they may regard investment in sustaining technologies, even those with high intrinsic risk, as safe because they
         understand the market need.

Drucker, <em class="calibre2">Innovation and Entrepreneurship</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1985). Below, in <a href="part0015_split_000.html">chapter 9</a>, I recount how software maker Intuit discovered that many of the people
         buying its <em class="calibre2">Quicken</em> personal financial management software were, in fact, using it to keep the books of their small businesses. Intuit had not
         anticipated this application, but it consequently adapted the product more closely to small business needs and launched <em class="calibre2">Quickbooks</em>, which captured more than 70 percent of the small business accounting software market within two years.
