<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_2">WHERE IS THE MARKET FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES?</h1>
      <p class="p">
         <a id="page209"></a>Having decided that electric vehicles are a potentially disruptive technology, my next challenge would be to define a marketing
         strategy that could lead my company to a legitimate, unsubsidized market in which electric cars might first be used. In formulating
         this marketing strategy, I would apply three findings from earlier chapters in this book.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">First, I would acknowledge that, by definition, <em class="calibre2">electric vehicles cannot initially be used in mainstream applications</em> because they do not satisfy the basic performance requirements of that market. I would therefore be sure that <em class="calibre2">everybody</em> having <em class="calibre2">anything</em> to do with my program understands this point: Although we don’t have a clue about where the market is, the one thing we know
         for certain is that it <em class="calibre2">isn’t</em> in an established automobile market segment. Ironically, I would expect most automakers to focus precisely and myopically
         on the mainstream market because of the principle of resource dependence and the principle that small markets don’t solve
         the growth and profit needs of big companies. I would not, therefore, follow the lead of other automakers in my search for
         customers, because 
         <a id="page210"></a>I would recognize that their instincts and capabilities are likely to be trained on the wrong target.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_7">7</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_7"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Nonetheless, my task is to find a market in which the vehicles can be used, because the early entrants into disruptive technology
         markets develop capabilities that constitute strong advantages over later entrants. They’re the ones that, from a profitable
         business base in this beachhead market, will most successfully throw impetus behind the sustaining innovations required to
         move the disruptive technology upmarket, toward the mainstream. Holding back from the market, waiting for laboratory researchers
         to develop a breakthrough battery technology, for example, is the path of least resistance for managers. But this strategy
         has <em class="calibre2">rarely</em> proven to be a viable route to success with a disruptive innovation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Historically, as we have seen, the very attributes that make disruptive technologies uncompetitive in mainstream markets actually
         count as <em class="calibre2">positive</em> attributes in their emerging value network. In disk drives, the smallness of 5.25-inch models made them unusable in large
         computers but very useful on the desktop. While the small bucket capacity and short reach of early hydraulic excavators made
         them useless in general excavation, their ability to dig precise, narrow trenches made them useful in residential construction.
         Odd as it sounds, therefore, I would direct my marketers to focus on uncovering <em class="calibre2">somewhere</em> a group of buyers who have an undiscovered need for a vehicle that accelerates relatively slowly and can’t be driven farther
         than 100 miles!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The second point on which I would base my marketing approach is that <em class="calibre2">no one can learn from market research what the early market(s) for electric vehicles will be.</em> I can hire consultants, but the only thing I can know for sure is that their findings will be wrong. Nor can customers tell
         me whether or how they might use electric vehicles, because <em class="calibre2">they</em> will discover how they might use the products at the same time as <em class="calibre2">we</em> discover it—just as Honda’s Supercub opened an unforeseen new application for motorbiking. The only useful information about
         the market will be what I create through expeditions into the market, through testing and probing, trial and error, by selling
         real products to real people who pay real money.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_8">8</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_8"></a> Government mandates, incidentally, are likely to distort rather than solve the problem of finding a market. I would, therefore,
         force my organization to live by its wits rather than to rely on capricious subsidies or noneconomic–based California regulation
         to fuel my business.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The third point is that my business plan must be a plan for <em class="calibre2">learning</em>, not one for executing a preconceived strategy. Although I will do my best to hit the right market with the right product
         and the right strategy the 
         <a id="page211"></a>first time out, there is a high probability that a better direction will emerge as the business heads toward its initial target.
         I must therefore plan to be wrong and to learn what is right as fast as possible.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_9">9</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_9"></a> I cannot spend all of my resources or all of my organizational credibility on an all-or-nothing first-time bet, as Apple
         did with its Newton or Hewlett-Packard did with its Kittyhawk. I need to conserve resources to get it right on the second
         or third try.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">These three concepts would constitute the foundation of my marketing strategy.</p>
