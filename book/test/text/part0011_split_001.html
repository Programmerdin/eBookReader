<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_1">INNOVATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION</h1>
      <p class="p">The mechanism through which customers control the investments of a firm is the resource allocation process—the process that
         determines which initiatives get staff and money and which don’t. Resource allocation and innovation are two sides of the
         same coin: Only those new product development projects that do get adequate funding, staffing, and management attention have
         a chance to succeed; those that are starved of resources will languish. Hence, the patterns of innovation in a company will
         mirror quite closely the patterns in which resources are allocated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Good resource allocation processes are designed to weed out proposals that customers don’t want. When these decision-making
         processes work well, if customers don’t want a product, it won’t get funded; if they do want it, it will. This is how things
         <em class="calibre2">must</em> work in great companies. They <em class="calibre2">must</em> invest in things customers want—and the better they become at doing this, the more successful they will be.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As we saw in <a href="part0009_split_000.html">chapter 4</a>, resource allocation is not simply a matter of top-down decision making followed by implementation.
         Typically, senior managers are asked to decide whether to fund a project only after many others at lower levels in the organization
         have already decided which types of project proposals they want to package and send on to senior management for approval and
         which they don’t think are worth the effort. Senior managers typically see only a well-screened subset of the innovative ideas
         generated.

         <a id="endnote_reference_3"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">And even after senior management has endorsed funding for a particular project, it is rarely a “done deal.” Many crucial resource
         allocation decisions are made after project approval—indeed, after product launch—by mid-level managers who set priorities
         when multiple projects and products compete for the time of the same people, equipment, and vendors. As management scholar
         Chester Barnard has noted:
      </p>
      <p class="ext">From the point of view of the relative importance of specific decisions, those of executives properly call for first attention.
         But from the point of view of aggregate importance, it is not decisions of executives, but of <em class="calibre2">non-executive participants</em> in organizations which should enlist major interest. [Italics added.]
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_4">4</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_4"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page104"></a>So how do non-executive participants make <em class="calibre2">their</em> resource allocation decisions? They decide which projects they will propose to senior management and which they will give
         priority to, based upon their understanding of what types of customers and products are most profitable to the company. Tightly
         coupled with this is their view of how their sponsorship of different proposals will affect their own career trajectories
         within the company, a view that is formed heavily by their understanding of what customers want and what types of products
         the company needs to sell more of in order to be more profitable. Individuals’ career trajectories can soar when they sponsor
         highly profitable innovation programs. It is through these mechanisms of seeking corporate profit and personal success, therefore,
         that customers exert a profound influence on the process of resource allocation, and hence on the patterns of innovation,
         in most companies.
