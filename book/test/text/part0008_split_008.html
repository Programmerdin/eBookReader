      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_49"><a href="part0008_split_000.html#endnote_reference_49">1.</a> A summary of how this same mechanism might have affected a broader range of industries can be found in Richard S. Rosenbloom
         and Clayton 
         <a id="page74"></a>M. Christensen, “Technological Discontinuities, Organizational Capabilities, and Strategic Commitments,” <em class="calibre2">Industrial and Corporate Change</em> (3), 1994, 655–686.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_50"><a href="part0008_split_001.html#endnote_reference_50">2.</a> This information and the data used to calculate the graphs in this section were provided by Dimitrie Toth, Jr., and Keith
         Haddock, both National Directors of the Historical Construction Equipment Association. The association has a wealth of information
         about the earthmoving equipment industry in its archives, and Toth and Haddock were most gracious in sharing their knowledge
         and information with me. I am also indebted to them for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this chapter. Other
         useful sources of information are Peter Grimshaw, <em class="calibre2">Excavators</em> (Poole, England: Blandford Press, 1985); The Olyslager Organisation, Inc., <em class="calibre2">Earthmoving Vehicles</em> (London: Frederick Warne &amp; Co., Ltd., 1972); Harold F. Williamson and Kenneth H. Myers, <em class="calibre2">Designed for Digging: The First 75 Years of Bucyrus Erie Company</em> (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1955); and J. L. Allhands, <em class="calibre2">Tools of the Earthmover</em> (Huntsville, TX: Sam Houston College Press, 1951).

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_51"><a href="part0008_split_001.html#endnote_reference_51">3.</a> Interestingly, the high success rate was only amongst the industry’s twenty-five largest firms. Only one of the seven smallest
         steam shovel manufacturers survived this sustaining technology change to internal gasoline combustion. Almost no information
         is available about these companies other than what is provided by their product brochures. I suspect, however, that the fact
         that the large and mid-sized firms cruised through this transition while the small ones were killed indicates that resources
         played a part in the story, a conclusion that complements the theoretical perspectives summarized in <a href="part0007_split_000.html">chapter 2</a> above. Some
         sustaining technologies clearly are so expensive to develop and implement or so dependent on proprietary or scarce expertise
         that some companies simply cannot successfully manage the transition. I am indebted to Professor Richard Rosenbloom for sharing
         his perspective on this issue.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_52"><a href="part0008_split_001.html#endnote_reference_52">4.</a> An example of this is the development of the first dragline, by Page, a Chicago area contractor. Page dug Chicago’s system
         of canals, and invented the drag-line in 1903 to do that job more effectively. Page draglines were later used extensively
         in digging the Panama Canal, alongside steam shovels made by Bucyrus Erie and Marion. This finding that customers were significant
         sources of sustaining innovations is consistent with Professor Eric von Hippel’s findings; see <em class="calibre2">The Sources of Innovation</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988). 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_53"><a href="part0008_split_002.html#endnote_reference_53">5.</a> The companies that survived the invasion of hydraulics in this way found safe haven in a particular high-end market. Bucyrus
         Erie and Marion, for example, became the dominant makers of the huge stripping shovels used in strip mines. Marion’s model
         6360 stripping shovel was the largest frontward-scooping shovel ever built, able to heft 180 cubic yards in its bucket. (An
         
         <a id="page75"></a>advertisement showing Paul Bunyan standing aside the 6360 is one of the most stunning pieces of advertising art I have seen.)
         Harnischfeger is the world’s largest maker of electric mining shovels, while Unit found a niche making the huge pedestal cranes
         used on offshore oil rigs. For a time, Northwest survived by making draglines for dredging ocean shipping lanes. P &amp; H and
         Lorain made huge cranes and draglines (all cable-actuated).

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_54"><a href="part0008_split_002.html#endnote_reference_54">6.</a> As the hydraulic excavator has matured, these companies have met with varying degrees of subsequent success. In 1996, the
         world’s highest-volume excavator companies, Demag and O &amp; K, were based in Germany.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_55"><a href="part0008_split_003.html#endnote_reference_55">7.</a> Technically, excavators that scoop their buckets forward are power <em class="calibre2">shovels.</em> This was the dominant design from 1837 through the early 1900s, and persisted as a major market segment through much of this
         century. Excavators that pull earth backward toward the cab are <em class="calibre2">backhoes.</em> As the hydraulic excavator became the dominant design during the 1970s, both types came to be called excavators. Until hydraulic
         actuation required the booms to be permanently attached to the unit, contractors could attach different booms or arms to their
         basic power units so that the same unit could work as a shovel, backhoe, or crane. Similarly, different buckets, sometimes
         called <em class="calibre2">dippers</em>, could be attached to move different types of material. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_56"><a href="part0008_split_003.html#endnote_reference_56">8.</a> The true measure of performance in excavation was the number of cubic yards of earth that could be moved per minute. This
         measure was so dependent upon operator skill and upon the type of earth being dug, however, that contractors adopted bucket
         size as the more robust, verifiable metric. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_57"><a href="part0008_split_004.html#endnote_reference_57">9.</a> These British and American pioneers were followed by several European manufacturers, each of which was also an entrant
         to the excavator industry, including France’s Poclain and Italy’s Bruneri Brothers. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_58"><a href="part0008_split_004.html#endnote_reference_58">10.</a> The ability to push the shovel into the earth was a major advantage to the hydraulics approach. The cable-actuated excavators
         that pulled earth toward the operator all had to rely on gravity to drive the teeth of the heavy shovel into the earth. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_59"><a href="part0008_split_005.html#endnote_reference_59">11.</a> Makers of early hybrid ocean transports, which were steam-powered but still outfitted with sails, used the same rationale
         for their design as did the Bucyrus Erie engineers: Steam power still was not reliable enough for the transoceanic market,
         so steam power plants had to be backed up by conventional technology. The advent of steam-powered ships and their substitution
         for wind-powered ships in the transoceanic business is itself a classic study of disruptive technology. When Robert Fulton
         sailed the first steamship up the Hudson River in 1819, it underperformed transoceanic sailing ships on nearly every dimension
         of performance: It cost more per mile to operate; it was slower; and it was prone to frequent breakdowns. Hence, it could
         not be used in the transoceanic value network and could only be applied in a 
         <a id="page76"></a>different value network, inland waterways, in which product performance was measured very differently. In rivers and lakes,
         the ability to move against the wind or in the absence of a wind was the attribute most highly valued by ship captains, and
         along that dimension, steam outperformed sail. Some scholars (see, for example, Richard Foster, in <em class="calibre2">Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage</em> [New York: Summit Books, 1986]) have marveled at how myopic were the makers of sailing ships, who stayed with their aging
         technology until the bitter end, in the early 1900s, completely ignoring steam power. Indeed, not a single maker of sailing
         ships survived the industry’s transition to steam power. The value network framework offers a perspective on this problem
         that these scholars seem to have ignored, however. It was not a problem of <em class="calibre2">knowing</em> about steam power or of having access to technology. The problem was that the customers of the sailing ship manufacturers,
         who were transoceanic shippers, could not use steam-powered ships until the turn of the century. To cultivate a position in
         steamship building, the makers of sailing ships would have had to engineer a major strategic reorientation into the inland
         waterway market, because that was the only value network where steam-powered vessels were valued throughout most of the 1800s.
         Hence, it was these firms’ reluctance or inability to change strategy, rather than their inability to change technology, that
         lay at the root of their failure in the face of steam-powered vessels.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_60"><a href="part0008_split_005.html#endnote_reference_60">12.</a> An exception to this is an unusual product introduced by Koehring in 1957: the Skooper combined cables and hydraulics
         to dig earth away from a facing wall; it did not dig down into the earth. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_61"><a href="part0008_split_005.html#endnote_reference_61">13.</a> Bucyrus Erie does not fit easily into either of these groups. It introduced a large hydraulic excavator in the 1950s,
         but subsequently withdrew it from the market. In the late 1960s, it acquired the “Dynahoe” line of hydraulic loader-backhoes
         from Hy-Dynamic Corporation and sold them as utility machines to its general excavation customers, but, again, dropped this
         product line as well.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_62"><a href="part0008_split_005.html#endnote_reference_62">14.</a> Caterpillar was a very late (but successful) entrant into the hydraulic excavation equipment industry, introducing its
         first model in 1972. Excavators were an extension of its line of dozers, scrapers, and graders. Caterpillar never participated
         in the excavation machine market when cable actuation was the dominant design.
