<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_4"><em class="calibre2">Value Networks Mirror Product Architecture</em></h1>
      <p class="p">Companies are embedded in value networks because their products generally are embedded, or nested hierarchically, as components
         within other products and eventually within end systems of use.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_31">8</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_31"></a> Consider a 1980s-vintage management information system (MIS) for a large organization, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The
         architecture of the MIS ties together various components—a mainframe computer; peripherals such as line printers and tape
         and disk drives; software; a large, air-conditioned room with cables running under a raised floor; and so on. At the next
         level, the mainframe computer is itself an architected system, comprising such components as a central processing unit, multi-chip
         packages and circuit boards, RAM circuits, terminals, controllers, and disk drives. Telescoping down still further, the disk
         drive is a system whose components include a motor, actuator, spindle, disks, heads, and controller. In turn, the disk itself
         can be analyzed as a system composed of an aluminum platter, magnetic material, adhesives, abrasives, lubricants, and coatings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Although the goods and services constituting such a system of use may all be produced within a single, extensively integrated
         corporation such as AT&amp;T or IBM, most are tradable, especially in more mature markets. This means that, while Figure 2.1 is
         drawn to describe the nested <em class="calibre2">physical</em> architecture of a product system, it also implies the existence of a <em class="calibre2">nested network of producers and markets</em> through which the components at each level are made and sold to integrators at the next higher level in the system. Firms
         that design and assemble disk drives, for example, such as Quantum and Maxtor, procure read-write heads from firms specializing
         in the manufacture of those heads, and they buy disks from other firms and spin motors, actuator motors, and integrated circuitry
         from still others. At the next higher level, firms that design and assemble computers may buy their integrated circuits, terminals,
         disk drives, IC packaging, and power supplies from various firms that manufacture those particular products. This nested commercial
         system is a <em class="calibre2">value network.</em></p>

         a corporate MIS system-of-use, for portable personal computing products, and for computer-automated design (CAD). Drawn only
         to convey the concept of how networks are bounded and may differ from each other, these depictions are not meant to represent
