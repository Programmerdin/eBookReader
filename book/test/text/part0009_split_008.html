         by Professor Malcom P. McNair, of the Harvard Business School, in a way that strikingly parallels the disk drive story. Writing
         in a history of retailing, McNair describes how successive waves of retailers entered the field with disruptive technologies
         (though he does not use the term):

      <p class="ext1">The wheel always revolves, sometimes slowly, sometimes more rapidly, 
         <a id="page94"></a>but it does not stand still. The cycle frequently begins with the bold new concept, the innovation. Somebody gets a bright
         new idea. There is a John Wanamaker, a George Hartford (A&amp;P), a Frank Woolworth, a W. T. Grant, a General Wood (Sears), a
         Michael Cullen (supermarkets), a Eugene Ferkauf. Such an innovator has an idea for a new kind of distributive enterprise.
         At the outset he is in bad odor, ridiculed, scorned, condemned as “illegitimate.” Bankers and investors are leery of him.
         But he attracts the public on the basis of the price appeal made possible by the low operating costs inherent in his innovation.
         As he goes along he trades up, improves the quality of his merchandise, improves the appearance and standing of his store,
         attains greater respectability….
      </p>
      <p class="ext1">    During this process of growth the institution rapidly becomes respectable in the eyes of both consumers and investors, but
         at the same time its capital investment increases and its operating costs tend to rise. Then the institution enters the stage
         of maturity…. The maturity phase soon tends to be followed by topheaviness … and eventual vulnerability. Vulnerability to
         what? Vulnerability to the next fellow who has a bright idea and who starts his business on a low-cost basis, slipping in
         under the umbrella that the old-line institutions have hoisted.

Smith, ed., <em class="calibre2">Competitive Distribution in a Free High-Level Economy and Its Implications for the University</em> (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1958) 17–18. In other words, the very costs required to become competitive in
         higher-end markets restrict downward mobility and create further incentive to move upmarket.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_65"><a href="part0009_split_003.html#endnote_reference_65">3.</a> The use of the term <em class="calibre2">systematic</em> in this sentence is important, because most resource allocation systems work in a systematic way—whether the system is formal
         or informal. It will be shown later in this book that a key to managers’ ability to confront disruptive technology successfully
         is their ability to intervene and make resource allocation decisions personally and persistently. Allocation systems are designed
         to weed out just such proposals as disruptive technologies. An excellent description of this dilemma can be found in Roger
         Martin, “Changing the Mind of the Corporation,” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, November–December 1993, 81–94.

         in the 1990s. Those integrated mills that are being built these days are in high-growth, rapidly developing countries such
         as Korea, Mexico, and Brazil.
