<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_1">THE DILEMMA</h1>
      <p class="p">To establish the theoretical depth of the ideas in this book, the breadth of their usefulness, and their applicability to
         the future as well as the past, I have divided this book into two parts. <a href="part0005.html">Part One</a>, <a href="part0006_split_000.html">chapters 1</a> through <a href="part0009_split_000.html">4</a>, builds a framework
         that explains why sound decisions by great managers can lead firms to failure. The picture these chapters paint is truly that
         of an innovator’s dilemma: the logical, competent decisions of management that are critical to the success of their companies
         are also the reasons why they lose their positions of leadership. <a href="part0010_split_000.html">Part Two</a>, <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapters 5</a> through <a href="part0016_split_000.html">10</a>, works to resolve the dilemma.
         Building on our understanding of why and under what circumstances new technologies have caused great firms to fail, it prescribes
         managerial solutions to the dilemma—how executives can simultaneously do what is right for the near-term health of their 
         <a id="pagexiv"></a>established businesses, while focusing adequate resources on the disruptive technologies that ultimately could lead to their
         downfall.
