<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_8">CREATING CAPABILITIES TO COPE WITH CHANGE</h1>
      <p class="p">If a manager determined that an employee was incapable of succeeding at a task, he or she would either find someone else to
         do the job or carefully train the employee to be able to succeed. Training often works, because individuals can become skilled
         at multiple tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Despite beliefs spawned by popular change-management and reengineering programs, processes are not nearly as flexible or “trainable”
         as are resources—and values are even less so. The processes that make an organization good at outsourcing components cannot
         simultaneously make it good at developing and manufacturing components in-house. Values that focus an organization’s priorities
         on high-margin products cannot simultaneously focus priorities on low-margin products. This is 
         <a id="page172"></a>why focused organizations perform so much better than unfocused ones: their processes and values are matched carefully with
         the set of tasks that need to be done.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">For these reasons, managers who determine that an organization’s capabilities aren’t suited for a new task, are faced with
         three options through which to create new capabilities. They can:
      </p>
      <ul class="calibre22">
      <li class="calibre23">Acquire a different organization whose processes and values are a close match with the new task</li>
      <li class="calibre23">Try to change the processes and values of the current organization</li>
      <li class="calibre23">Separate out an independent organization and develop within it the new processes and values that are required to solve
         the new problem</li>
</ul>
