      <p class="p">Companies that have tried to develop new capabilities within established organizational units also have a spotty track record,
         unfortunately. Assembling a beefed-up set of resources as a means of changing what an existing organization can do is relatively
         straightforward. People with new skills can be hired, technology can be licensed, capital can be raised, and product lines,
         brands, and information can be acquired. Too often, however, resources such as these are then plugged into fundamentally unchanged
         processes—and little change results. For example, through the 1970s and 1980s Toyota upended the world automobile industry
         through its innovation in development, manufacturing, and supply-chain <em class="calibre2">processes</em>— without investing aggressively in resources such as advanced manufacturing or information-processing technology. General
         Motors responded by investing nearly $60 billion in manufacturing <em class="calibre2">resources</em>—computer-automated equipment that was designed to reduce cost and improve 
         <a id="page175"></a>quality. Using state-of-the-art resources in antiquated processes, however, made little difference in General Motors’ performance,
         because it is in its processes and values that the organization’s most fundamental capabilities lie. Processes and values
         define how resources—many of which can be bought and sold, hired and fired—are combined to create value.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, processes are very hard to change—for two reasons. The first is that organizational boundaries are often drawn
         to facilitate the operation of present processes. Those boundaries can impede the creation of new processes that cut across
         those boundaries. When new challenges require different people or groups to interact differently than they habitually have
         done—addressing different challenges with different timing than historically had been required—managers need to pull the relevant
         people out of the existing organization and draw a new boundary around a new group. New team boundaries enable or facilitate
         new patterns of working together that ultimately can coalesce as new processes—new capabilities for transforming inputs into
         outputs. Professors Steven C. Wheelwright and Kim B. Clark have called these structures heavyweight teams.

         <a id="endnote_reference_9"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The second reason new process capabilities are hard to develop is that, in some cases, managers don’t <em class="calibre2">want</em> to throw the existing processes out—the methods work perfectly well in doing what they were designed to do. As noted above,
         while resources tend to be flexible and can be used in a variety of situations, processes and values are by their very nature
         <em class="calibre2">inflexible</em>. Their very <em class="calibre2">raison d’e^tre</em> is to cause the same thing to be done consistently, over and over again. Processes are meant <em class="calibre2">not</em> to change.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">When disruptive change appears on the horizon, managers need to assemble the capabilities to confront the change <em class="calibre2">before</em> it has affected the mainstream business. In other words, they need an organization that is geared toward the new challenge
         before the old one, whose processes are tuned to the existing business model, has reached a crisis that demands fundamental
         change.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Because of its task-specific nature, it is impossible to ask one process to do two fundamentally different things. Consider
         the examples presented in <a href="part0013_split_000.html">chapter 7</a>, for instance. The market research and planning processes that are appropriate for the
         launch of new products into existing markets simply aren’t capable of guiding a company into emerging, poorly defined markets.
         And the processes by which a company would experimentally and intuitively feel its way into emerging markets would constitute
         suicide if employed in a well-defined existing business. If a company needs to do 
         <a id="page176"></a>both types of tasks simultaneously, then it needs two very different processes. And it is very difficult for a single organizational
         unit to employ fundamentally different, opposing processes. As shown below, this is why managers need to create different
         teams, within which different processes to address new problems can be defined and refined.
