      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_1"><a href="part0011_split_000.html#endnote_reference_1">1.</a> The theory of resource dependence has been most thoroughly argued by Jeffrey Pfeffer and Gerald R. Salancik in <em class="calibre2">The External Control of Organizations: A Resource Dependence Perspective</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1978).

         <a id="page118"></a>This implies that, in managing business under both normal conditions and conditions of assault by a disruptive technology,
         the choice of which customers the firm will serve has enormous strategic consequences.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_3"><a href="part0011_split_001.html#endnote_reference_3">3.</a> Joseph L. Bower, in <em class="calibre2">Managing the Resource Allocation Process</em> (Homewood, IL: Richard D. Irwin, 1972), presents an elegant and compelling picture of the resource allocation process.

      </p>
      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_5"><a href="part0011_split_003.html#endnote_reference_5">5.</a> Quantum’s spin-out of the Hardcard effort and its subsequent strategic reorientation is an example of the processes of
         strategy change described by Robert Burgelman, in “Intraorganizational Ecology of Strategy-Making and Organizational Adaptation:
         Theory and Field Research,” <em class="calibre2">Organization Science</em> (2), 1991, 239–262, as essentially a process of natural selection through which suboptimal strategic initiatives lose out
         to optimal ones in the internal competition for corporate resources. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_6"><a href="part0011_split_005.html#endnote_reference_6">6.</a> The failure of Micropolis to maintain simultaneous competitive commitments to both its established technology and the new
         5.25-inch technology is consistent with the technological histories recounted by James Utterback, in <em class="calibre2">Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation</em> (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1994). Utterback found that firms that attempted to develop radically new technology
         almost always tried to maintain simultaneous commitment to the old and that they almost always failed.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_7"><a href="part0011_split_006.html#endnote_reference_7">7.</a> A set of industries in which disruptive technologies are believed to have played a role in toppling leading firms is presented
         by Richard S. Rosenbloom and Clayton M. Christensen in “Technological Discontinuities, Organizational Capabilities, and Strategic
         Commitments,” <em class="calibre2">Industrial and Corporate Change</em> (3), 1994, 655–685.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_8"><a href="part0011_split_007.html#endnote_reference_8">8.</a> In the 1990s, DEC finally set up a Personal Computer Division in its attempt to build a significant personal computer business.
         It was not as autonomous from DEC’s mainstream business; however, the Quantum and Control Data spin-outs were. Although DEC
         set up specific performance metrics for the PC division, it was still held, <em class="calibre2">de facto</em>, to corporate standards for gross margins and revenue growth.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_10"><a href="part0011_split_008.html#endnote_reference_10">10.</a> When this book was being written, Kmart was a crippled company, having been beaten in a game of strategy and operational
         excellence by WalMart. Nonetheless, during the preceding two decades, Kmart had been a highly successful retailer, creating
         extraordinary value for Kresge shareholders. Kmart’s present competitive struggles are unrelated to Kresge’s strategy in meeting
         the original disruptive threat of discounting.

This was an extraordinarily elegant, rational argument for the consolidation, clearly crafted by a
         corporate spin-doctor extraordinaire. Never mind that no Woolworth stores approached 100,000 square feet in size!

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_16"><a href="part0011_split_009.html#endnote_reference_16">16.</a> Business historian Richard Tedlow noted that the same dilemma had confronted A&amp;P’s executives as they deliberated whether
         to adopt the disruptive supermarket retailing format: 
         
      </p>
      <div class="calibre21"><p class="ext1">The supermarket entrepreneurs competed against A&amp;P not by doing better what A&amp;P was the best company in the world at doing,
         but by doing something that A&amp;P did not want to do at all. The greatest entrepreneurial failure in this story is Kroger. This
         company was second in the market, and one of its own employees (who left to found the world’s first supermarket) knew how
         to make it first. Kroger executives did not listen. Perhaps it was lack of imagination or perhaps, like the executives at
         A&amp;P, those at Kroger also had too much invested in the standard way of doing business. If the executives at A&amp;P endorsed the
         supermarket revolution, they were ruining their own distribution system. That is why they sat by paralyzed, unable to act
         until it was almost too late. In the end, A&amp;P had little choice. The company could ruin its own system, or see others do it.
