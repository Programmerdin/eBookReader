  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_1"><a href="part0012_split_002.html#endnote_reference_1">1.</a> The benefits of persistently pursuing incremental improvements versus taking big strategic leaps have been capably argued
   by Robert Hayes in “Strategic Planning: Forward in Reverse?” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, November– December, 1985, 190–197. 
   
  </p>
  <p class="ntx">        I believe that there are some specific situations in which leadership in sustaining technology is crucial, however. In a private
   conversation, Professor Kim Clark characterized these situations as those affecting <em class="calibre2">knife-edge</em> businesses, that is, businesses in which the basis of competition is simple and unidimensional and there is little room for
   error. An example of such a knife-edge industry is the photolithographic aligner (PLA) industry, studied by Rebecca M. Henderson
   and Kim B. Clark, in “Architectural Innovation: The Reconfiguration of Existing Systems and the Failure of Established Firms,”
   <em class="calibre2">Administrative Science Quarterly</em> (35), March, 1990, 9–30. In this case, aligner manufacturers failed when they fell behind technologically in the face of
   sustaining architectural changes. This is because the basis of competition in the PLA industry was quite straightforward even
   though the products themselves were very complex: products either made the narrowest line width on silicon wafers of any in
   the industry or no one bought them. This is because PLA customers, makers of integrated circuits, simply had to have the fastest
   and most capable photolithographic alignment equipment or they 
   <a id="page139"></a>could not remain competitive in their own markets. The knife-edge existed because product functionality was the only basis
   of competition: PLA manufacturers would either fall off one side to rapid success or off the other side to failure. Clearly,
   such knife-edge situations make leadership in sustaining technology very important.
  </p>
  <p class="ntx">        In most other sustaining situations, however, leadership is <em class="calibre2">not</em> crucial. This far more common situation is the subject of Richard S. Rosenbloom’s study of the transition by National Cash
   Register from electro-mechanical to electronic technology. (See Richard S. Rosenbloom, “From Gears to Chips: The Transformation
   of NCR and Harris in the Digital Era,” Working paper, Harvard Business School Business History Seminar, 1988). In this case,
   NCR was very late in its industry in developing and launching a line of electronic cash registers. So late was NCR with this
   technology, in fact, that its sales of new cash registers dropped essentially to zero for an entire year in the early 1980s.
   Nonetheless, the company had such a strong field service capability that it survived by serving its installed base for the
   year it took to develop and launch its electronic cash registers. NCR then leveraged the strength of its brand name and field
   sales presence to quickly recapture its share of the market.
  </p>
  <p class="ntx">        Even though a cash register is a simpler machine than a photolithographic aligner, I would characterize its market as complex,
   in that there are multiple bases of competition, and hence multiple ways to survive. As a general rule, the more complex a
   market, the less important is leadership in sustaining technological innovations. It is in dealing with knife-edge markets
   or with disruptive technologies that leadership appears to be crucial. I am indebted to Professors Kim B. Clark and Robert
   Hayes for their contributions to my thinking on this topic.
  </p>
  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_2"><a href="part0012_split_002.html#endnote_reference_2">2.</a> This is not to say that firms whose product performance or product cost consistently lagged behind the competition were
   able to prosper. I assert that there is no evidence that leadership in sustaining technological innovation confers a discernible
   and enduring competitive advantage over companies that have adopted a follower strategy because there are numerous ways to
   “skin the cat” in improving the performance of a complex product such as a disk drive. Developing and adopting new component
   technologies, such as thin-film and magneto-resistive heads, is one way to improve performance, but there are innumerable
   other avenues for extending the performance of conventional technologies while waiting for new approaches to become better
   understood and more reliable. This argument is presented more fully in Clayton M. Christensen, “Exploring the Limits of the
   Technology S-Curve,” <em class="calibre2">Production and Operations Management</em> (1), 1992, 334–366. 
   
  </p>
  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_3"><a href="part0012_split_003.html#endnote_reference_3">3.</a> For the purposes of this analysis, a technology was classed as “new or unproven” if less than two years had elapsed from
   the time it had first 
   <a id="page140"></a>appeared in a product that was manufactured and sold by a company somewhere in the world or if, even though it had been in
   the market for more than two years, less than 20 percent of the disk drive makers had used the technology in one of their
   products. 
   
  </p>
  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_4"><a href="part0012_split_003.html#endnote_reference_4">4.</a> In this analysis, <em class="calibre2">emerging markets</em> or value networks were those in which two years or less had elapsed since the first rigid disk drive had been used with that
   class of computers; <em class="calibre2">established markets</em> or value networks were those in which more than two years had elapsed since the first drive was used. 
   
  </p>
  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_5"><a href="part0012_split_003.html#endnote_reference_5">5.</a> Entry by acquisition was a rare route of entry in the disk drive industry. Xerox followed this strategy, acquiring Diablo,
   Century Data, and Shugart Associates. The performance of these companies after acquisition was so poor that few other companies
   followed Xerox’s lead. The only other example of entry by acquisition was the acquisition of Tandon by Western Digital, a
   manufacturer of controllers. In the case of Xerox and Western Digital, the entry strategy of the firms they <em class="calibre2">acquired</em> is recorded in Table 6.1. Similarly, the start-up of Plus Development Corporation, a spin-out of Quantum, appears in Table
   6.1 as a separate company. 
   
  </p>
  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_6"><a href="part0012_split_003.html#endnote_reference_6">6.</a> The evidence summarized in this matrix may be of some use to venture capital investors, as a general way to frame the riskiness
   of proposed investments. It suggests that start-ups which propose to commercialize a breakthrough technology that is essentially
   sustaining in character have a far lower likelihood of success than start-ups whose vision is to use proven technology to
   disrupt an established industry with something that is simpler, more reliable, and more convenient. The established firms
   in an industry have every incentive to catch up with a supposed sustaining technological breakthrough, while they have strong
   disincentives to pursue disruptive initiatives. 
   
  </p>
  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_7"><a href="part0012_split_003.html#endnote_reference_7">7.</a> Not all of the small, emerging markets actually became large ones. The market for removable drive modules, for example,
   remained a small niche for more than a decade, only beginning to grow to significant size in the mid-1990s. The conclusion
   in the text that emerging markets offer a higher probability for success reflects the average, not an invariant result. 
   
  </p>
  <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_8"><a href="part0012_split_003.html#endnote_reference_8">8.</a> The notions that one ought not accept the risks of innovating simultaneously along both market and technology dimensions
   are often discussed among venture capitalists. It is also a focus of <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapter 5</a> in Lowell W. Steele, <em class="calibre2">Managing Technology</em> (New York: McGraw Hill, 1989). The study reported here of the posterior probabilities of success for different innovation
   strategies builds upon the concepts of Steele and Lyle Ochs (whom Steele cites). I was also stimulated by ideas presented
   in Allan N. Afuah and Nik Bahram, “The Hypercube of Innovation,” <em class="calibre2">Research Policy</em> (21), 1992.
