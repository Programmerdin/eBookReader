      <p class="p">The engineers then showed their prototypes to marketing personnel, asking whether a market for the smaller, less expensive
         (and lower performance) drives existed. The marketing organization, using its habitual procedure for testing the market appeal
         of new drives, showed the prototypes to lead customers of the existing product line, asking them for an evaluation.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_39">16</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_39"></a> Thus, Seagate marketers tested the new 3.5-inch drives with IBM’s PC Division and other makers of XT-and AT-class desktop
         personal computers—even though the drives had significantly less capacity than the mainstream desktop market demanded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Not surprisingly, therefore, IBM showed no interest in Seagate’s disruptive 
         <a id="page44"></a>3.5-inch drives. IBM’s engineers and marketers were looking for 40 and 60 MB drives, and they already had a slot for 5.25-inch
         drives designed into their computer; they needed new drives that would take them further along their established performance
         trajectory. Finding little customer interest, Seagate’s marketers drew up pessimistic sales forecasts. In addition, because
         the products were simpler, with lower performance, forecast profit margins were lower than those for higher performance products,
         and Seagate’s financial analysts, therefore, joined their marketing colleagues in opposing the disruptive program. Working
         from such input, senior managers shelved the 3.5-inch drive—just as it was becoming firmly established in the laptop market.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This was a complex decision, made in a context of competing proposals to expend the same resources to develop new products
         that marketers felt were critical to remaining competitive with current customers and achieving aggressive growth and profit
         targets. “We needed a new model,” recalled a former Seagate manager, “which could become the next ST412 [a very successful
         product generating $300 million sales annually in the desktop market that was near the end of its life cycle]. Our forecasts
         for the 3.5-inch drive were under $50 million because the laptop market was just emerging, and the 3.5-inch product just didn’t
         fit the bill.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Seagate managers made an explicit decision not to pursue the disruptive technology. In other cases, managers did approve resources
         for pursuing a disruptive product—but, in the day-to-day decisions about how time and money would actually be allocated, engineers
         and marketers, acting in the best interests of the company, consciously and unconsciously starved the disruptive project of
         resources necessary for a timely launch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">When engineers at Control Data, the leading 14-inch drive maker, were officially chartered to develop CDC’s initial 8-inch
         drives, its customers were looking for an average of 300 MB per computer, whereas CDC’s earliest 8-inch drives offered less
         than 60 MB. The 8-inch project was given low priority, and engineers assigned to its development kept getting pulled off to
         work on problems with 14-inch drives being designed for more important customers. Similar problems plagued the belated launches
         of Quantum’s and Micropolis’s 5.25-inch products.
