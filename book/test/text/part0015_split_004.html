<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_4">OTHER CONSISTENT CHARACTERISTICS OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
      <p class="p">Two additional important characteristics of disruptive technologies consistently affect product life cycles and competitive
         dynamics: First, the attributes that make disruptive products worthless in mainstream markets typically become their strongest
         selling points in emerging markets; and second, disruptive products tend to be simpler, cheaper, and more reliable and convenient
         than established products. Managers must understand these characteristics to effectively chart their own strategies for designing,
         building, and selling disruptive products. Even though the specific market applications for disruptive technologies cannot
         be known in advance, managers can bet on these two regularities.
