      <p class="p">
         <a id="pagexvii"></a>The last element of the failure framework, the conclusion by established companies that investing aggressively in disruptive
         technologies is not a rational financial decision for them to make, has three bases. First, disruptive products are simpler
         and cheaper; they generally promise lower margins, not greater profits. Second, disruptive technologies typically are first
         commercialized in emerging or insignificant markets. And third, leading firms’ most profitable customers generally don’t want,
         and indeed initially can’t use, products based on disruptive technologies. By and large, a disruptive technology is initially
         embraced by the least profitable customers in a market. Hence, most companies with a practiced discipline of listening to
         their best customers and identifying new products that promise greater profitability and growth are rarely able to build a
         case for investing in disruptive technologies until it is too late.
