<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_8">PERFORMANCE OVERSUPPLY IN THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF INSULIN</h1>
      <p class="p">Another case of performance oversupply and disruptive technology precipitating a change in the basis of competition—and threatening
         a change in industry leadership—is found in the worldwide insulin business. In 1922, four researchers in Toronto first successfully
         extracted insulin from the pancreases of animals and injected it, with miraculous results, into humans with diabetes. Because
         insulin was extracted from the ground-up pancreases of cows and pigs, improving the purity of insulin (measured in impure
         parts per million, or ppm) constituted a critical trajectory of performance improvement. Impurities dropped from 50,000 ppm
         in 1925 to 10,000 ppm in 1950 to 10 ppm in 1980, primarily as the result of persistent investment and effort by the world’s
         leading insulin manufacturer, Eli Lilly and Company.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Despite this improvement, animal insulins, which are slightly different 
         <a id="page195"></a>from human insulin, caused a fraction of a percent of diabetic patients to build up resistance in their immune systems. Thus,
         in 1978, Eli Lilly contracted with Genentech to create genetically altered bacteria that could produce insulin proteins that
         were the structural equivalent of human insulin proteins and 100 percent pure. The project was technically successful, and
         in the early 1980s, after a nearly $1 billion investment, Lilly introduced its Humulin-brand insulin to the market. Priced
         at a 25 percent premium over insulins of animal extraction, because of its human equivalence and its purity, Humulin was the
         first commercial-scale product for human consumption to emerge from the biotechnology industry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The market’s response to this technological miracle, however, was tepid. Lilly found it very difficult to sustain a premium
         price over animal insulin, and the growth in the sales volume of Humulin was disappointingly slow. “In retrospect,” noted
         a Lilly researcher, “the market was not terribly dissatisfied with pork insulin. In fact, it was pretty happy with it.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0015_split_011.html#endnote_text_8">8</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_8"></a> Lilly had spent enormous capital and organizational energy overshooting the market’s demand for product purity. Once again,
         this was a differentiated product to which the market did not accord a price premium because the performance it provided exceeded
         what the market demanded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Meanwhile, Novo, a much smaller Danish insulin maker, was busy developing a line of insulin <em class="calibre2">pens</em>, a more convenient way for taking insulin. Conventionally, people with diabetes carried a separate syringe, inserted its
         needle into one glass insulin vial, pulled its plunger out to draw slightly more than the desired amount of insulin into the
         syringe, and held up the needle and flicked the syringe several times to dislodge any air bubbles that clung to the cylinder
         walls. They generally then had to repeat this process with a second, slower acting type of insulin. Only after squeezing the
         plunger slightly to force any remaining bubbles—and, inevitably, some insulin—out of the syringe could they inject themselves
         with the insulin. This process typically took one to two minutes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Novo’s pen, in contrast, held a cartridge containing a couple of weeks’ supply of insulin, usually mixtures of both the fast-acting
         and the gradually released types. People using the Novo pen simply had to turn a small dial to the amount of insulin they
         needed to inject, poke the pen’s needle under the skin, and press a button. The procedure took less than ten seconds. In contrast
         to Lilly’s struggle to command a premium price for Humulin, Novo’s convenient pens easily sustained a 30 percent price premium
         per unit of insulin. Through the 1980s, propelled largely by the success of its 
         <a id="page196"></a>line of pens and pre-mixed cartridges, Novo increased its share of the worldwide insulin market substantially—and profitably.
         Lilly’s and Novo’s experiences offer further proof that a product whose performance exceeds market demands suffers commodity-like
         pricing, while disruptive products that redefine the basis of competition command a premium.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Teaching the Harvard Business School case to executives and MBA students about Lilly overshooting the market demand for insulin
         purity has been one of my most interesting professional experiences. In every class, the majority of students quickly pounce
         on Lilly for having missed something so obvious—that only a fraction of a percent of people with diabetes develop insulin
         resistance—and that the differentiation between highly purified pork insulin at 10 ppm and perfectly pure Humulin was not
         significant. Surely, they assert, a few simple focus groups in which patients and doctors were asked whether they wanted purer
         insulin would have given Lilly adequate guidance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In every discussion, however, more thoughtful students soon begin to sway class opinion toward the view that (as we have seen
         over and over) what is obvious in retrospect might not be at all obvious in the thick of battle. Of all the physicians to
         whom Lilly’s marketers listened, for example, which ones tended to carry the most credibility? Endocrinologists whose practices
         focused on diabetes care, the leading customers in this business. What sorts of patients are most likely to consume the professional
         interests of these specialists? Those with the most advanced and intractable problems, among which insulin resistance was
         prominent. What, therefore, were these leading customers likely to tell Lilly’s marketers when they asked what should be done
         to improve the next-generation insulin product? Indeed, the power and influence of leading customers is a major reason why
         companies’ product development trajectories overshoot the demands of mainstream markets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Furthermore, thoughtful students observe that it would not even occur to most marketing managers to ask the question of whether
         a 100 percent pure human insulin might exceed market needs. For more than fifty years in a very successful company with a
         very strong culture, greater purity was the very definition of a better product. Coming up with purer insulins had <em class="calibre2">always</em> been the formula for staying ahead of the competition. Greater purity had <em class="calibre2">always</em> been a catching story that the salesforce could use to attract the time and attention of busy physicians. What in the company’s
         history would cause its culture-based assumptions suddenly to change 
         <a id="page197"></a>and its executives to begin asking questions that never before had needed to be answered?
