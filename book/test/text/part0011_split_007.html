<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_7">DEC, IBM, AND THE PERSONAL COMPUTER</h1>
      <p class="p">Quite naturally, the computer industry and the disk drive industry have parallel histories, because value networks of the
         latter are embedded in those of the former. In fact, if the axes and intersecting trajectories depicted on the disk drive
         trajectory map in Figure 1.7 were relabeled with computer-relevant terms, it would summarize equally well the failure of leading
         computer industry firms. IBM, the industry’s first leader, sold its mainframe computers to the central accounting and data
         processing departments of large organizations. The emergence of the minicomputer represented a disruptive technology to IBM
         and its competitors. Their customers had no use for it; it promised lower, not higher, margins; and the market initially was
         significantly smaller. As a result, the makers of mainframes ignored the minicomputer for years, allowing a set of 
         <a id="page109"></a>entrants—Digital Equipment, Data General, Prime, Wang, and Nixdorf—to create and dominate that market. IBM ultimately introduced
         its own line of minicomputers, but it did so primarily as a defensive measure, when the capabilities of minicomputers had
         advanced to the point that they were performance-competitive with the computing needs of some of IBM’s customers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Similarly, none of the makers of minicomputers became a significant factor in the desktop personal computer market, because
         to them the desktop computer was a disruptive technology. The PC market was created by another set of entrants, including
         Apple, Commodore, Tandy, and IBM. The minicomputer makers were exceptionally prosperous and highly regarded by investors,
         the business press, and students of good manage-ment—until the late 1980s, when the technological trajectory of the desktop
         computer intersected with the performance demanded by those who had previously bought minicomputers. The missile-like attack
         of the desktop computer from below severely wounded every minicomputer maker. Several of them failed. None established a viable
         position in the desktop personal computer value network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">A similar sequence of events characterized the emergence of the portable computer, where the market was created and dominated
         by a set of entrants like Toshiba, Sharp, and Zenith. Apple and IBM, the leading desktop makers, did not introduce portable
         models until the portables’ performance trajectory intersected with the computing needs of their customers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Probably none of these firms has been so deeply wounded by disruptive technology as Digital Equipment. DEC fell from fortune
         to folly in just a few years, as stand-alone workstations and networked desktop computers obviated most customers’ needs for
         minicomputers almost overnight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">DEC didn’t stumble for lack of trying, of course. Four times between 1983 and 1995 it introduced lines of personal computers
         targeted at consumers, products that were technologically much simpler than DEC’s minicomputers. But four times it failed
         to build businesses in this value network that were perceived within the company as profitable. Four times it withdrew from
         the personal computer market. Why? DEC launched all four forays from within the mainstream company.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_8">8</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_8"></a> For all of the reasons so far recounted, even though executive-level decisions lay behind the move into the PC business,
         those who made the day-to-day resource allocation decisions in the company never saw the sense in investing the necessary
         money, time, and energy in low-margin products that their 
         <a id="page110"></a>customers didn’t want. Higher-performance initiatives that promised up-scale margins, such as DEC’s super-fast Alpha microprocessor
         and its adventure into mainframe computers, captured the resources instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In trying to enter the desktop personal computing business from within its mainstream organization, DEC was forced to straddle
         the two different cost structures intrinsic to two different value networks. It simply couldn’t hack away enough overhead
         cost to be competitive in low-end personal computers because it needed those costs to remain competitive in its higher-performance
         products.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Yet IBM’s success in the first five years of the personal computing industry stands in stark contrast to the failure of the
         other leading mainframe and minicomputer makers to catch the disruptive desktop computing wave. How did IBM do it? It created
         an autonomous organization in Florida, far away from its New York state headquarters, that was free to procure components
         from any source, to sell through its own channels, and to forge a cost structure appropriate to the technological and competitive
         requirements of the personal computing market. The organization was free to succeed along metrics of success that were relevant
         to the personal computing market. In fact, some have argued that IBM’s subsequent decision to link its personal computer division
         much more closely to its mainstream organization was an important factor in IBM’s difficulties in maintaining its profitability
         and market share in the personal computer industry. It seems to be very difficult to manage the peaceful, unambiguous coexistence
         of two cost structures, and two models for how to make money, within a single company.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The conclusion that a single organization might simply be incapable of competently pursuing disruptive technology, while remaining
         competitive in mainstream markets, bothers some “can-do” managers—and, in fact, most managers try to do exactly what Micropolis
         and DEC did: maintain their competitive intensity in the mainstream, while simultaneously trying to pursue disruptive technology.
         The evidence is strong that such efforts rarely succeed; position in one market will suffer unless two separate organizations,
         embedded within the appropriate value networks, pursue their separate customers.
