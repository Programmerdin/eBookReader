      <p class="p">Flash technology is what Henderson and Clark would call <em class="calibre2">radical</em> technology. Its product architecture and fundamental technological concept are novel compared to disk drives. The organizational
         structure viewpoint would predict that, unless they created organizationally independent groups to design flash products,
         established firms would stumble badly. Seagate and Quantum did, indeed, rely on independent groups and did develop competitive
         products.
