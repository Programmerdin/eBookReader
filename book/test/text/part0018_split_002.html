      <ol class="calibre17">
      <li value="1" class="calibre18">Companies Depend on Customers and Investors for Resources In order to survive, companies must provide customers and
         investors with the products, services, and profits that they require. The highest performing companies, therefore, have well-developed
         systems for killing ideas that their customers don’t want. As a result, these companies find it very difficult to invest adequate
         resources in disruptive technologies—lower-margin opportunities 
         <a id="page233"></a>that their customers don’t want—until their customers want them. And by then, it is too late.</li>
      <li value="2" class="calibre19">Small Markets Don’t Solve the Growth Needs of Large Companies To maintain their share prices and create internal opportunities
         for their employees, successful companies need to grow. It isn’t necessary that they increase their growth rates, but they
         must maintain them. And as they get larger, they need increasing amounts of new revenue just to maintain the same growth rate.
         Therefore, it becomes progressively more difficult for them to enter the newer, smaller markets that are destined to become
         the large markets of the future. To maintain their growth rates, they must focus on large markets.</li>
      <li value="3" class="calibre19">Markets That Don’t Exist Can’t Be Analyzed Sound market research and good planning followed by execution according
         to plan are the hallmarks of good management. But companies whose investment processes demand quantification of market size
         and financial returns before they can enter a market get paralyzed when faced with disruptive technologies because they demand
         data on markets that don’t yet exist.</li>
      <li value="4" class="calibre20">Technology Supply May Not Equal Market Demand Although disruptive technologies can initially be used only in small
         markets, they eventually become competitive in mainstream markets. This is because the pace of technological progress often
         exceeds the rate of improvement that mainstream customers want or can absorb. As a result, the products that are currently
         in the mainstream eventually will overshoot the performance that mainstream markets demand, while the disruptive technologies
         that underperform relative to customer expectations in the mainstream market today may become directly competitive tomorrow.
         Once two or more products are offering adequate performance, customers will find other criteria for choosing. These criteria
         tend to move toward reliability, convenience, and price, all of which are areas in which the newer technologies often have
         advantages.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="spb">A big mistake that managers make in dealing with new technologies is that they try to fight or overcome the Principles of
         Disruptive Technology. Applying the traditional management practices that lead to success with sustaining technologies always
         leads to failure with disruptive technologies, 
         <a id="page234"></a>says Professor Christensen. The more productive route, which often leads to success, he says, is to understand the natural
         laws that apply to disruptive technologies and to use them to create new markets and new products. Only by recognizing the
         dynamics of how disruptive technologies develop can managers respond effectively to the opportunities that they present.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Specifically, he advises managers faced with disruptive technologies to:</p>
      <ol class="calibre17">
      <li value="1" class="calibre18">Give responsibility for disruptive technologies to organizations whose customers need them so that resources will
         flow to them.</li>
      <li value="2" class="calibre19">Set up a separate organization small enough to get excited by small gains.</li>
      <li value="3" class="calibre19">Plan for failure. Don’t bet all your resources on being right the first time. Think of your initial efforts at commercializing
         a disruptive technology as learning opportunities. Make revisions as you gather data.</li>
      <li value="4" class="calibre18">Don’t count on breakthroughs. Move ahead early and find the market for the current attributes of the technology. You
         will find it outside the current mainstream market. You will also find that the attributes that make disruptive technologies
         unattractive to mainstream markets are the attributes on which the new markets will be built.</li>
      </ol>
