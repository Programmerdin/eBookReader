<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_11">APPENDIX 1.1:<br class="calibre1"/>A NOTE ON THE DATA AND METHOD<br class="calibre1"/>USED TO GENERATE FIGURE 1.7</h1>
      <p class="p">The trajectories mapped in Figure 1.7 were calculated as follows. Data on the capacity provided with computers was obtained
         from <em class="calibre2">Data Sources</em>, an annual publication listing the technical specifications of all computer models available from every computer manufacturer.
         For instances in which particular models were available with different features and configurations, the manufacturer provided
         <em class="calibre2">Data Sources</em> with a “typical” system configuration with defined random access memory (RAM) capacity, performance specifications of peripheral
         equipment 
         <a id="page25"></a>(including disk drives), list prices, and year of introduction. For instances in which a given computer model was offered
         for sale over a sequence of years, the hard disk capacity provided in the typical configuration typically increased. <em class="calibre2">Data Sources</em> used the categories mainframe, mini/midrange, desktop personal, portable and laptop, and notebook. As of 1993, 1.8-inch drives
         were not being used in hand-held computers, so no data on that potential market existed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">For Figure 1.7, for each year and each class of computers, all models available for sale were ranked by price and the hard
         disk capacity provided with the median-priced model identified. The best-fit lines through the resultant time series were
         plotted as the solid lines in Figure 1.7 for expository simplification to indicate the trend in typical machines. In reality,
         of course, there is a wide band around these lines. The <em class="calibre2">frontier</em> of performance—the highest capacity offered with the most expensive computers—was substantially higher than the typical values
         shown.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The dotted lines in Figure 1.7 represent the best-fit line through the unweighted average capacity of all disk drives introduced
         for sale in each given architecture for each year. This data was taken from <em class="calibre2">Disk/Trend Report.</em> Again, for expository simplification, only this average line is shown. There was a wide band of capacities introduced for
         sale in each year, so that the frontier or highest capacity drive introduced in each year was substantially above the average
         shown. Stated in another way, a distinction must be made between the full range of products available for purchase and those
         in typical systems. The upper and lower bands around the median and average figures shown in Figure 1.7 are generally parallel
         to the lines shown.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Because higher capacity drives were available in the market than were offered with the median-priced systems, the solid-line
         trajectories in Figure 1.7, as I state in the text, represent the capacities “demanded” in each market. In other words, the
         capacity per machine was not constrained by technological availability. Rather, it represents the selection of hard disk capacity
         by computer users, given the prevailing cost.
