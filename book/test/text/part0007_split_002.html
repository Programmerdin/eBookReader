<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_2">CAPABILITIES AND RADICAL TECHNOLOGY AS AN EXPLANATION</h1>
      <p class="p">In assessing blame for the failure of good companies, the distinction is sometimes made between innovations requiring very
         different technological capabilities, that is, so-called radical change, and those that build upon well-practiced technological
         capabilities, often called incremental innovations.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_26">3</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_26"></a> The notion is that the magnitude of the technological change relative to the companies’ capabilities will determine which
         firms triumph after a technology invades an industry. Scholars who support this view find that established firms tend to be
         good at improving what they have long been good at doing, and that entrant firms seem better suited for exploiting radically
         new technologies, often because they import the technology 
         <a id="page31"></a>into one industry from another, where they had already developed and practiced it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Clark, for example, has reasoned that companies build the technological capabilities in a product such as an automobile hierarchically
         and experientially.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_27">4</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_27"></a> An organization’s historical choices about which technological problems it would solve and which it would avoid determine
         the sorts of skills and knowledge it accumulates. When optimal resolution of a product or process performance problem demands
         a very different set of knowledge than a firm has accumulated, it may very well stumble. The research of Tushman, Anderson,
         and their associates supports Clark’s hypothesis.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_28">5</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_28"></a> They found that firms failed when a technological change destroyed the value of competencies previously cultivated and succeeded
         when new technologies enhanced them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The factors identified by these scholars undoubtedly affect the fortunes of firms confronted with new technologies. Yet the
         disk drive industry displays a series of anomalies accounted for by neither set of theories. Industry leaders first introduced
         sustaining technologies of <em class="calibre2">every</em> sort, including architectural and component innovations that rendered prior competencies irrelevant and made massive investments
         in skills and assets obsolete. Nevertheless, these same firms stumbled over technologically straightforward but disruptive
         changes such as the 8-inch drive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The history of the disk drive industry, indeed, gives a very different meaning to what constitutes a radical innovation among
         leading, established firms. As we saw, the nature of the technology involved (components versus architecture and incremental
         versus radical), the magnitude of the risk, and the time horizon over which the risks needed to be taken had little relationship
         to the patterns of leadership and followership observed. Rather, if their customers needed an innovation, the leading firms
         somehow mustered the resources and wherewithal to develop and adopt it. Conversely, if their customers did not want or need
         an innovation, these firms found it impossible to commercialize even technologically simple innovations.
