<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_10">RIGHT AND WRONG STRATEGIES</h1>
      <p class="p">Which of the strategies illustrated in Figure 9.4 is best? This study finds clear evidence that there is no one best strategy.
         Any of the three, consciously pursued, can be successful. Hewlett-Packard’s pursuit of the first strategy in its laser jet
         printer business has been enormously profitable. In this instance, it has been a safe strategy as well, because HP is attacking
         its own position with disruptive ink-jet technology. Compaq Computer and the trinity of Intel, Microsoft, and the disk drive
         makers have successfully—at least to date—implemented the second and third strategies, respectively.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">These successful practitioners have in common their apparent under-standing—whether explicit or intuitive—of both their customers’
         trajectories of need and their own technologists’ trajectories of supply. Understanding these trajectories is the key to their
         success thus far. But 
         <a id="page201"></a>the list of firms that have consistently done this is disturbingly short. Most well-run companies migrate unconsciously to
         the northeast, setting themselves up to be caught by a change in the basis of competition and an attack from below by disruptive
         technology.
