      <p class="p">Disruptive technologies, though they initially can only be used in small markets remote from the mainstream, are disruptive
         because they subsequently can become fully performance-competitive within the mainstream market against established products.
         As depicted in Figure I.1 (on page xvi), this happens because the pace of technological progress in products frequently exceeds
         the rate of performance improvement that mainstream customers demand or can absorb. As a consequence, products whose features
         and functionality closely match market needs today often follow a trajectory of improvement by which they overshoot mainstream
         market needs tomorrow. And products that seriously underperform today, relative to customer expectations in mainstream markets,
         may become directly performance-competitive tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><a href="part0015_split_000.html">Chapter 9</a> shows that when this happens, in markets as diverse as disk drives, accounting software, and diabetes care, the
         basis of competition— the criteria by which customers choose one product over another— changes. When the performance of two
         or more competing products has improved beyond what the market demands, customers can no longer base their choice upon which
         is the higher performing product. The basis of product choice often evolves from functionality to reliability, then to convenience,
         and, ultimately, to price.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Many students of business have described phases of the product life cycle in various ways. But <a href="part0015_split_000.html">chapter 9</a> proposes that the
         phenomenon in which product performance overshoots market demands is the primary mechanism driving shifts in the phases of
         the product life cycle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In their efforts to stay ahead by developing competitively superior products, many companies don’t realize the speed at which
         they are moving 
         <a id="pagexxiv"></a>up-market, over-satisfying the needs of their original customers as they race the competition toward higher-performance, higher-margin
         markets. In doing so, they create a vacuum at lower price points into which competitors employing disruptive technologies
         can enter. Only those companies that carefully measure trends in how their mainstream customers <em class="calibre2">use</em> their products can catch the points at which the basis of competition will change in the markets they serve.
