         <a id="page161"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> When managers assign employees to tackle a critical innovation, they instinctively work to match the requirements of the job
         with the capabilities of the individuals whom they charge to do it. In evaluating whether an employee is capable of successfully
         executing a job, managers will assess whether he or she has the requisite knowledge, judgment, skill, perspective, and energy.
         Managers will also assess the employee’s values<em class="calibre2">—</em>the criteria by which he or she tends to decide what should and shouldn’t be done. Indeed, the hallmark of a great manager
         is the ability to identify the right person for the right job, and to train his or her employees so that they have the capabilities
         to succeed at the jobs they are given.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, some managers don’t think as rigorously about whether their <em class="calibre2">organizations</em> have the capability to successfully execute jobs that may be given to them. Frequently, they assume that if the people working
         on a project individually have the requisite capabilities to get the job done well, then the organization in which they work
         will also have the same capability to succeed. This often is not the case. One could take two sets of identically capable
         people and put them to work in two different organizations, and what they accomplish would likely be significantly different.
         This is because organizations themselves, independent of the people and other resources in them, have capabilities. To succeed
         consistently, 
         <a id="page162"></a>good managers need to be skilled not just in choosing, training, and motivating the right people for the right job, but in
         choosing, building, and preparing the right <em class="calibre2">organization</em> for the job as well.

      <p class="calibre5">The purpose of this chapter is to describe the theory that lies behind the empirical observations made in <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapters 5</a>, <a href="part0012_split_000.html">6</a>, and
         <a href="part0013_split_000.html">7</a>—in particular, the observation that the only companies that succeeded in addressing disruptive technology were those that
         created independent organizations whose size matched the size of the opportunity. The notion that organizations have “core
         competencies” has been a popular one for much of the last decade.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0014_split_013.html#endnote_text_1">1</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_1"></a> In practice, however, most managers have found that the concept is sufficiently vague that some supposed “competence” can
         be cited in support of a bewildering variety of innovation proposals. This chapter brings greater precision to the core competence
         concept, by presenting a framework to help managers understand, when they are confronted with a necessary change, whether
         the organizations over which they preside are competent or incompetent of tackling the challenges that lie ahead.
