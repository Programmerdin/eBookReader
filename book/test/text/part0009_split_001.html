<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_1">THE GREAT NORTHEAST MIGRATION IN DISK DRIVES</h1>
      <p class="p">Figure 4.1 plots in more detail the upmarket movement of Seagate Technology, whose strategy was typical of most disk drive
         manufacturers. Recall that Seagate had spawned, and then grew to dominate, the value network for desktop computing. Its product
         position relative to capacity demanded in its market is mapped by vertical lines which span from the lowest-to the highest-capacity
         drives in its product line, in each of the years shown. The black rectangle on the line measuring each year’s capacity span
         shows the median capacity of the drives Seagate introduced in each of those years.

      <p class="spb">
         <a id="page79"></a>Between 1983 and 1985, the center of gravity of Seagate’s product line was positioned squarely on the average capacity demanded
         in the desktop segment. It was between 1987 and 1989 that the disruptive 3.5-inch form invaded the desktop market from below.
         Seagate responded to that attack, not by fighting the disruptive technology head-on, but by retreating up-market. It continued
         to offer models in the capacity ranges the desktop PC market demanded, but by 1993 the focus of its energy had clearly shifted
         to the market for mid-range computers, such as file servers and engineering workstations.

      <p class="calibre5">Indeed, disruptive technologies have such a devastating impact because the firms that first commercialized each generation
         of disruptive disk drives chose <em class="calibre2">not</em> to remain contained within their initial value network. Rather, they reached as far upmarket as they could in each new product
         generation, until their drives packed the capacity to appeal to the value networks above them. It is this upward mobility
         that makes disruptive technologies so dangerous to established firms—and so attractive to entrants.
