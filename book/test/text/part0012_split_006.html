<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_6">CASE STUDY: WAITING UNTIL A MARKET IS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE INTERESTING</h1>
 <p class="p">A second way that many large companies have responded to the disruptive technology trap is to wait for emerging markets to
  “get large enough to be interesting” before they enter. Sometimes this works, as IBM’s well-timed 1981 entry into the desktop
  PC business demonstrated. But it is a seductive logic that can backfire, because the firms creating new markets often forge
  capabilities that are closely attuned to the requirements of those markets and that later entrants find difficult to replicate.
  Two examples from the disk drive industry illustrate this problem.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Priam Corporation, which ascended to leadership of the market for 8-inch drives sold to minicomputer makers after its entry
  in 1978, had built the capability in that market to develop its drives on a two-year rhythm. This pace of new product introduction
  was consistent with the rhythm by 
  <a id="page133"></a>which its customers, minicomputer makers, introduced their new products into the market.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Seagate’s first 5.25-inch drive, introduced to the emerging desktop market in 1980, was disruptively slow compared to the
  performance of Priam’s drives in the minicomputer market. But by 1983, Seagate and the other firms that led in implementing
  the disruptive 5.25-inch technology had developed a <em class="calibre2">one-year</em> product introduction rhythm in their market. Because Seagate and Priam achieved similar percentage improvements in speed
  with each new product generation, Seagate, by introducing new generations on a one-year rhythm, quickly began to converge
  on Priam’s performance advantage.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Priam introduced its first 5.25-inch drive in 1982. But the rhythm by which it introduced its subsequent 5.25-inch models
  was the two-year capability it had honed in the minicomputer market—not the one-year cycle required to compete in the desktop
  marketplace. As a consequence, it was never able to secure a <em class="calibre2">single</em> major OEM order from a desktop computer manufacturer: It just couldn’t hit their design windows with its new products. And
  Seagate, by taking many more steps forward than did Priam, was able to close the performance gap between them. Priam closed
  its doors in 1990.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">The second example occurred in the next disruptive generation. Seagate Technology was the second in the industry to develop
  a 3.5-inch drive in 1984. Analysts at one point had speculated that Seagate might ship 3.5-inch drives as early as 1985; and
  indeed, Seagate showed a 10 MB model at the fall 1985 Comdex Show. When Seagate still had not shipped a 3.5-inch drive by
  late 1986, CEO Al Shugart explained, “So far, there just isn’t a big enough market for it, as yet.”
  <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_13">13</a></sup>
  <a id="endnote_reference_13"></a> In 1987, when the 3.5-inch market at $1.6 billion had gotten “big enough to be interesting,” Seagate finally launched its
  offering. By 1991, however, even though Seagate had by then built substantial volume in 3.5-inch drives, it had not yet succeeded
  in selling a single drive to a maker of portable computers: Its models were all sold into the desktop market, defensively
  cannibalizing its sales of 5.25-inch drives. Why?
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">One likely reason for this phenomenon is that Conner Peripherals, which pioneered and maintained the lead in selling 3.5-inch
  drives to portable computer makers, fundamentally changed the way drive makers had to approach the portables market. As one
  Conner executive described it,
 </p>
 <p class="ext">
  <a id="page134"></a>From the beginning of the OEM disk drive industry, product development had proceeded in three sequential steps. First you
  designed the drive; then you made it; and then you sold it. We changed all that. We first <em class="calibre2">sell</em> the drives; then we design them; and then we build them.
  <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_14">14</a></sup>
  <a id="endnote_reference_14"></a>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">In other words, Conner set a pattern whereby drives for the portable computer market were custom-designed for major customers.
  And it refined a set of capabilities in its marketing, engineering, and manufacturing processes that were tailored to that
  pattern.
  <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_15">15</a></sup>
  <a id="endnote_reference_15"></a> Said another Conner executive, “Seagate was never able to figure out how to sell drives in the portable market. They just
  never got it.”
