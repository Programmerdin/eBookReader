      <p class="p">In 1980, Seagate Technology introduced 5.25-inch disk drives. Their capacities of 5 and 10 MB were of no interest to minicomputer
         manufacturers, who were demanding drives of 40 and 60 MB from their suppliers. Seagate and other firms that entered with 5.25-inch
         drives in the period 1980 to 1983 (for example, Miniscribe, Computer Memories, and International Memories) had to pioneer
         new applications for their products and turned primarily to desktop personal computer makers. By 1990, the use of hard drives
         in desktop computers was an obvious application for magnetic recording. It was not at all clear in 1980, however, when the
         market was just emerging, that many people could ever afford or use a hard drive on the desktop. The early 5.25-inch drive
         makers found this application (one might even say that they <em class="calibre2">enabled</em> it) by trial and error, selling drives to whomever would buy them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Once the use of hard drives was established in desktop PCs, the disk capacity shipped with the median-priced machine (that
         is, the capacity demanded by the general PC user) increased about 25 percent per year. Again, the technology improved at nearly
         twice the rate demanded in the new market: The capacity of new 5.25-inch drives increased about 50 percent per year between
         1980 and 1990. As in the 8-inch for 14-inch substitution, the first firms to produce 5.25-inch drives were entrants; on average,
         established firms lagged behind entrants by two years. By 1985, only half of the firms producing 8-inch drives had introduced
         5.25-inch models. The other half never did.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Growth in the use of 5.25-inch drives occurred in two waves. The first followed creation of a new application for rigid disk
         drives: desktop computing, in which product attributes such as physical size, relatively unimportant in established applications,
         were highly valued. The second wave followed substitution of 5.25-inch disks for larger drives in established minicomputer
         and mainframe computer markets, as the rapidly increasing capacity of 5.25-inch drives intersected the more slowly growing
         
         <a id="page20"></a>trajectories of capacity demanded in these markets. Of the four leading 8-inch drive makers—Shugart Associates, Micropolis,
         Priam, and Quantum—only Micropolis survived to become a significant manufacturer of 5.25-inch drives, and that was accomplished
         only with Herculean managerial effort, as described in <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapter 5</a>.
