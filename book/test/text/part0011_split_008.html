<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_8">KRESGE, WOOLWORTH, AND DISCOUNT RETAILING</h1>
      <p class="p">In few industries has the impact of disruptive technology been felt so pervasively as in retailing, where discounters seized
         dominance from traditional 
         <a id="page111"></a>department and variety stores. The technology of discount retailing was disruptive to traditional operations because the quality
         of service and selection offered by discounters played havoc with the accustomed metrics of quality retailing. Moreover, the
         cost structure required to compete profitably in discount retailing was fundamentally different than that which department
         stores had developed to compete within their value networks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The first discount store was Korvette’s, which began operating a number of outlets in New York in the mid-1950s. Korvette’s
         and its imitators operated at the very low end of retailing’s product line, selling nationally known brands of standard hard
         goods at 20 to 40 percent below department store prices. They focused on products that “sold themselves” because customers
         already knew how to use them. Relying on national brand image to establish the value and quality of their products, these
         discounters eliminated the need for knowledgeable salespeople; they also focused on the group of customers least attractive
         to mainstream retailers: “young wives of blue collar workers with young children.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_9">9</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_9"></a> This was counter to the upscale formulas department stores historically had used to define quality retailing and to improve
         profits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Discounters didn’t accept lower profits than those of traditional retailers, however; they just earned their profits through
         a different formula. In the simplest terms, retailers cover their costs through the gross margin, or markup, they charge over
         the cost of the merchandise they sell. Traditional department stores historically marked merchandise up by 40 percent and
         turned their inventory over four times in a year—that is, they earned 40 percent on the amount they invested in inventory,
         four times during the year, for a total return on inventory investment of 160 percent. Variety stores earned somewhat lower
         profits through a formula similar to that used by the department stores. Discount retailers earned a return on inventory investment
         similar to that of department stores, but through a different model: low gross margins and high inventory turns. Table 5.1
         summarizes the three positions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The history of discount retailing vividly recalls the history of minimill steel making. Just like the minimills, discounters
         took advantage of their cost structure to move upmarket and seize share from competing traditional retailers at a stunning
         rate: first at the low end, in brand-name hard goods such as hardware, small appliances, and luggage, and later in territory
         further to the northeast such as home furnishings and clothing. Figure 5.2 illustrates how stunning the discounters’ invasion
         was: Their share of retailing revenues in the categories of goods they sold rose from 10 percent in 1960 to nearly 40 percent
         a scant six years later.

      <p class="spb">Just as in disk drives and excavators, a few of the leading traditional retailers—notably S. S. Kresge, F. W. Woolworth, and
         Dayton Hudson— saw the disruptive approach coming and invested early. None of the other 
         <a id="page113"></a>major retail chains, including Sears, Montgomery Ward, J. C. Penney, and R. H. Macy, made a significant attempt to create
         a business in discount retailing. Kresge (with its Kmart chain) and Dayton Hudson (with the Target chain) succeeded.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_10">10</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_10"></a> They both created focused discount retailing organizations that were independent from their traditional business. They recognized
         and harnessed the forces of resource dependence. By contrast, Woolworth failed in its venture (Woolco), trying to launch it
         from within the F. W. Woolworth variety store company. A detailed comparison of the approaches of Kresge and Woolworth, which
         started from very similar positions, lends additional insight into why establishing independent organizations to pursue disruptive
         technology seems to be a necessary condition for success.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">S. S. Kresge, then the world’s second largest variety store chain, began studying discount retailing in 1957, while discounting
         was still in its infancy. By 1961, both Kresge and its rival F. W. Woolworth (the world’s largest variety store operator)
         had announced initiatives to enter discount retailing. Both firms opened stores in 1962, within three months of each other.
         The performance of the Woolco and Kmart ventures they launched, however, subsequently differed dramatically. A decade later,
         Kmart’s sales approached $3.5 billion while Woolco’s sales were languishing unprofitably at $0.9 billion.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_11">11</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_11"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In making its commitment to discount retailing, Kresge decided to exit the variety store business entirely: In 1959 it hired
         a new CEO, Harry Cunningham, whose sole mission was to convert Kresge into a discounting powerhouse. Cunningham, in turn,
         brought in an entirely new management team, so that by 1961 there “was not a single operating vice president, regional manager,
         assistant regional manager, or regional merchandise manager who was not new on the job.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_12">12</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_12"></a> In 1961 Cunningham stopped opening any new variety stores, embarking instead on a program of closing about 10 percent of
         Kresge’s existing variety operations each year. This represented a wholesale refocusing of the company on discount retailing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Woolworth, on the other hand, attempted to support a program of sustaining improvements in technology, capacity, and facilities
         in its core variety store businesses while simultaneously investing in disruptive discounting. The managers charged with improving
         the performance of Woolworth’s variety stores were also charged with building “the largest chain of discount houses in America.”
         CEO Robert Kirkwood asserted that Woolco “would not conflict with the company’s plans for growth 
         <a id="page114"></a>and expansion in the regular variety store operations,” and that no existing stores would be converted to a discount format.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_13">13</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_13"></a> Indeed, as discount retailing hit its most frenzied expansion phase in the 1960s, Woolworth was opening new variety stores
         at the pace it had set in the 1950s.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Unfortunately (but predictably), Woolworth proved unable to sustain within a single organization the two different cultures,
         and two different models of how to make a profit, that were required to be successful in variety and discount retailing. By
         1967 it had dropped the term “discount” from all Woolco advertising, adopting the term “promotional department store” instead.
         Although initially Woolworth had set up a separate administrative staff for its Woolco operation, by 1971 more rational, cost-conscious
         heads had prevailed.
      </p>
      <p class="ext">In a move designed to increase sales per square foot in both Woolco and Woolworth divisions, the two subsidiaries have been
         consolidated operationally on a regional basis. Company officials say the consolidation—which involves buying offices, distribution
         facilities and management personnel at the regional level—will help both to develop better merchandise and more efficient
         stores. Woolco will gain the benefits of Woolworth’s buying resources, distribution facilities and additional expertise in
         developing specialty departments. In return, Woolworth will gain Woolco’s knowhow in locating, designing, promoting and operating
         large stores over 100,000 sq. ft.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_14">14</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_14"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="spb">What was the impact of this cost-saving consolidation? It provided more evidence that two models for how to make money cannot
         peacefully coexist within a single organization. Within a year of this consolidation, Woolco had increased its markups such
         that its gross margins were the highest in the discount industry—about 33 percent. In the process, its inventory turns fell
         from the 7x it originally had achieved to 4x. The formula for profit that had long sustained F. W. Woolworth (35 percent margins
         for four inventory turns or 140 percent return on inventory investment) was ultimately demanded of Woolco as well. (See Figure
         5.3.) Woolco was no longer a discounter—in name or in fact. Not surprisingly, Woolworth’s venture into discount retailing
         failed: It closed its last Woolco store in 1982.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Woolworth’s organizational strategy for succeeding in disruptive discount retailing was the same as Digital Equipment’s strategy
         for launching its personal computer business. Both founded new ventures within the mainstream organization that had to earn
         money by mainstream rules, and neither could achieve the cost structure and profit model required to succeed in the mainstream
         value network.
