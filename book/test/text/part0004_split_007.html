<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_7">TESTING THE FAILURE FRAMEWORK</h1>
      <p class="p">This book defines the problem of disruptive technologies and describes how they can be managed, taking care to establish what
         researchers call the <em class="calibre2">internal</em> and <em class="calibre2">external</em> validity of its propositions. <a href="part0006_split_000.html">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="part0007_split_000.html">2</a> develop the failure framework in the context of the disk drive industry, and
         the initial pages of <a href="part0009_split_000.html">chapters 4</a> through <a href="part0014_split_000.html">8</a> return to that industry to build a progressively deeper understanding of why disruptive
         technologies are such vexatious phenomena for good managers to confront successfully. The reason for painting such a complete
         picture of a single industry is to establish the internal validity of the failure framework. If a framework or model cannot
         reliably explain what happened within a single industry, it cannot be applied to other situations with confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><a href="part0008_split_000.html">Chapter 3</a> and the latter sections of <a href="part0009_split_000.html">chapters 4</a> through <a href="part0015_split_000.html">9</a> are structured to explore the external validity of the failure framework—the
         conditions in which we might expect the framework to yield useful insights. <a href="part0008_split_000.html">Chapter 3</a> uses the framework to examine why the
         leading makers of cable excavators were driven from the earthmoving market by makers of hydraulic machines, and <a href="part0009_split_000.html">chapter 4</a>
         discusses why the world’s integrated steel makers have floundered in the face of minimill technology. <a href="part0011_split_000.html">Chapter 5</a> uses the model
         to examine the success of discount retailers, relative to conventional chain and department stores, and to probe the impact
         of disruptive technologies in the motor control and printer industries. <a href="part0012_split_000.html">Chapter 6</a> examines 
         <a id="pagexviii"></a>the emerging personal digital assistant industry and reviews how the electric motor control industry was upended by disruptive
         technology. <a href="part0013_split_000.html">Chapter 7</a> recounts how entrants using disruptive technologies in motorcycles and logic circuitry dethroned industry
         leaders; <a href="part0014_split_000.html">chapter 8</a> shows how and why computer makers fell victim to disruption; and <a href="part0015_split_000.html">chapter 9</a> spotlights the same phenomena
         in the accounting software and insulin businesses. <a href="part0016_split_000.html">Chapter 10</a> applies the framework to a case study of the electric vehicle,
         summarizing the lessons learned from the other industry studies, showing how they can be used to assess the opportunity and
         threat of electric vehicles, and describing how they might be applied to make an electric vehicle commercially successful.
         <a href="part0017_split_000.html">Chapter 11</a> summarizes the book’s findings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Taken in sum, these chapters present a theoretically strong, broadly valid, and managerially practical framework for understanding
         disruptive technologies and how they have precipitated the fall from industry leadership of some of history’s best-managed
         companies.
