<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_5">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESSES AND VALUES, AND SUCCESS IN ADDRESSING SUSTAINING VS. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
      <p class="p">The resources-processes-values (RPV) framework has been a useful tool for me to understand the findings from my research relating
         to the differences in companies’ track records in sustaining and disruptive technologies. Recall that we identified 116 new
         technologies that were introduced in the industry’s history. Of these, 111 were sustaining technologies, in that their impact
         was to improve the performance of disk drives. Some of these were incremental improvements while others, such as magneto-resistive
         heads, represented discontinuous leaps forward in performance. In all 111 cases of sustaining technology, the companies that
         led in developing and introducing the new technology were the 
         <a id="page167"></a>companies that had led in the old technology. The success rate of the established firms in developing and adopting sustaining
         technologies was 100 percent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The other five of these 116 technologies were disruptive innovations—in each case, smaller disk drives that were slower and
         had lower capacity than those used in the mainstream market. There was no new technology involved in these disruptive products.
         Yet <em class="calibre2">none</em> of the industry’s leading companies remained atop the industry after these disruptive innovations entered the market—their
         batting average was <em class="calibre2">zero</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Why such markedly different batting averages when playing the sustaining versus disruptive games? The answer lies in the RPV
         framework of organizational capabilities. The industry leaders developed and introduced sustaining technologies over and over
         again. Month after month, year after year, as they introduced new and improved products in order to gain an edge over the
         competition, the leading companies developed processes for evaluating the technological potential and assessing their customers’
         needs for alternative sustaining technologies. In the parlance of this chapter, the organizations developed a <em class="calibre2">capability</em> for doing these things, which resided in their processes. Sustaining technology investments also fit the values of the leading
         companies, in that they promised higher margins from better products sold to their leading-edge customers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">On the other hand, the disruptive innovations occurred so intermittently that no company had a routinized process for handling
         them. Furthermore, because the disruptive products promised lower profit margins per unit sold and could not be used by their
         best customers, these innovations were inconsistent with the leading companies’ values. The leading disk drive companies had
         the <em class="calibre2">resources</em>—the people, money, and technology—required to succeed at both sustaining and disruptive technologies. But their processes
         and values constituted disabilities in their efforts to succeed at disruptive technologies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Large companies often surrender emerging growth markets because smaller, disruptive companies are actually more <em class="calibre2">capable</em> of pursuing them. Though start-ups lack resources, it doesn’t matter. Their values can embrace small markets, and their cost
         structures can accommodate lower margins. Their market research and resource allocation processes allow managers to proceed
         intuitively rather than having to be backed up by careful research and analysis, presented in PowerPoint. All 
         <a id="page168"></a>of these advantages add up to enormous opportunity or looming disaster—depending upon your perspective.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Managers who face the need to change or innovate, therefore, need to do more than assign the right resources to the problem.
         They need to be sure that the organization in which those resources will be working is itself capable of succeeding—and in
         making that assessment, managers must scrutinize whether the organization’s processes and values fit the problem.
