      <p class="p">Intuit, the maker of financial management software, is known primarily for its extraordinarily successful personal financial
         software package, <em class="calibre2">Quicken. Quicken</em> dominates its market because it is easy and convenient. Its makers pride themselves on the fact that the vast majority of
         <em class="calibre2">Quicken</em> customers simply buy the program, boot it up on their computers, and begin using it without having to read the instruction
         manual. Its developers made it so convenient to use, and continue to make it simpler and more convenient, by watching how
         customers <em class="calibre2">use</em> the product, not by listening to what they or the “experts” say they need. By watching for small hints of where the product
         might be difficult or confusing to use, the developers direct their energies toward a progressively simpler, more convenient
         product that provides adequate, rather than superior, functionality.

      <p class="calibre5">Less well known is Intuit’s commanding 70 percent share of the North American small business accounting software market.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0015_split_011.html#endnote_text_6">6</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_6"></a> Intuit captured that share as a late entrant when it launched <em class="calibre2">Quickbooks</em>, a product based on three simple insights. First, previously available small business accounting packages had been created
         under the close guidance of certified public accountants and required users to have a basic knowledge of accounting (debits
         and credits, assets and liabilities, and so on) and to make every journal entry twice (thus providing an audit trail for each
         transaction). Second, most existing packages offered a comprehensive and sophisticated array of reports and analyses, an array
         that grew ever more complicated and specialized with each new release as developers sought to differentiate their products
         by offering greater functionality. And third, 85 percent of all companies in the United States were too small to employ an
         accountant: The books were kept by the proprietors or by family members, who had no need for or understanding of most of the
         entries and reports available from mainstream accounting software. They did not know what an audit trail was, let alone sense
         a need to use one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Scott Cook, Intuit’s founder, surmised that most of these small companies 
         <a id="page194"></a>were run by proprietors who relied more on their intuition and direct knowledge of the business than on the information contained
         in accounting reports. In other words, Cook decided that the makers of accounting software for small businesses had overshot
         the functionality required by that market, thus creating an opportunity for a disruptive software technology that provided
         adequate, not superior functionality and was simple and more convenient to use. Intuit’s disruptive <em class="calibre2">Quickbooks</em> changed the basis of product competition from functionality to convenience and captured 70 percent of its market within two
         years of its introduction.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0015_split_011.html#endnote_text_7">7</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_7"></a> In fact, by 1995 <em class="calibre2">Quickbooks</em> accounted for a larger share of Intuit’s revenues than did <em class="calibre2">Quicken.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre5">The response of established makers of small business accounting software to Intuit’s invasion, quite predictably, has been
         to move upmarket, continuing to release packages loaded with greater functionality; these focus on specific market subsegments,
         targeted at sophisticated users of information systems at loftier tiers of the market. Of the three leading suppliers of small
         business accounting software (each of which claimed about 30 percent of the market in 1992), one has disappeared and one is
         languishing. The third has introduced a simplified product to counter the success of <em class="calibre2">Quickbooks</em>, but it has claimed only a tiny portion of the market.
