 </h1>
 <p class="p">
  <a id="page122"></a>A crucial strategic decision in the management of innovation is whether it is important to be a leader or acceptable to be
  a follower. Volumes have been written on first-mover advantages, and an offsetting amount on the wisdom of waiting until the
  innovation’s major risks have been resolved by the pioneering firms. “You can always tell who the pioneers were,” an old management
  adage goes. “They’re the ones with the arrows in their backs.” As with most disagreements in management theory, neither position
  is always right. Indeed, some findings from the study of the disk drive industry give some insight into when leadership is
  critical and when followership makes better sense.
