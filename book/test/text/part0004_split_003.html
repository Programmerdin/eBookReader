<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_3">WHY GOOD MANAGEMENT CAN LEAD TO FAILURE</h1>
      <p class="p">The failure framework is built upon three findings from this study. The first is that there is a strategically important distinction
         between what I call <em class="calibre2">sustaining</em> technologies and those that are <em class="calibre2">disruptive.</em> These concepts are very different from the incremental-versus-radical distinction that has 
         <a id="pagexv"></a>characterized many studies of this problem. Second, the pace of technological progress can, and often does, outstrip what
         markets need. This means that the relevance and competitiveness of different technological approaches can change with respect
         to different markets over time. And third, customers and financial structures of successful companies color heavily the sorts
         of investments that appear to be attractive to them, relative to certain types of entering firms.
