         manufacturers’ protests that, given the performance and cost of the vehicles they had been able to design, there was no demand
         for electric vehicles.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_2"><a href="part0016_split_001.html#endnote_reference_2">2.</a> An excellent study on this subject is summarized in Dorothy Leonard-Barton, <em class="calibre2">Wellsprings of Knowledge</em> (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1995).

         Sales Company at the CARB (California Air Resources Board) Workshop on Electric Vehicle Consumer Marketability held in El
         Monte, California, on June 28, 1995.

         Virginia. It was augmented with information from the following sources: Frank Keith, Paul Norton, and Dana Sue Potestio, <em class="calibre2">Electric Vehicles: Promise and Reality</em> (California State Legislative Report [19], No. 10, July, 1994); W. P.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_5"><a href="part0016_split_001.html#endnote_reference_5">5.</a> Based on the graphs in Figure 10.1, it will take a long time for disruptive electric vehicle technology to become competitive
         in mainstream markets if future rates of improvement resemble those of the past. The historical rate of performance improvement
         is, of course, no guarantee that the future rate can be maintained. Technologists very well might run into insurmountable
         technological barriers. What we <em class="calibre2">can</em> say for sure, however, is that the incentive of disruptive technologists to find some way to engineer around such barriers
         will be just as strong as the disincentive that established car makers will feel to move down-market. If present rates of
         improvement continue, however, 
         <a id="page221"></a>we would expect the cruising range of electric cars, for example, to intersect with the average range demanded in the mainstream
         market by 2015, and electric vehicle acceleration to intersect with mainstream demands by 2020. Clearly, as will be discussed
         below, it will be crucial for electric vehicle innovators to find markets that value the attributes of the technology as it
         currently is capable, rather than waiting until the technology improves to the point that it can be used in the mainstream
         market.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_6"><a href="part0016_split_001.html#endnote_reference_6">6.</a> This statement was made by John R. Wallace, Director of Electric Vehicle Programs, Ford Motor Company, at the CARB Workshop
         on Electric Vehicle Consumer Marketability held at El Monte, California, on June 28, 1995.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_7"><a href="part0016_split_002.html#endnote_reference_7">7.</a> It is remarkable how instinctively and consistently good companies try to force innovations toward their existing base
         of customers, regardless of whether they are sustaining or disruptive in character. We have seen this several times in this
         book: for example, in mechanical excavators, where Bucyrus Erie tried with its “Hydrohoe” to make hydraulic excavation technology
         work for mainstream excavation contractors; in motorcycles, where Harley-Davidson tried to launch low-end brand name bikes
         through its dealer network; and in the electric vehicle case described here, in which Chrysler packed nearly a ton of batteries
         into a minivan. Charles Ferguson and Charles Morris, in their book <em class="calibre2">Computer Wars</em>, recount a similar story about IBM’s efforts to commercialize Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor technology.
         RISC was invented at IBM, and its inventors built computers with RISC chips that were “screamingly fast.” IBM subsequently
         spent massive amounts of time, money, and manpower trying to make the RISC chip work in its main line of minicomputers. This
         required so many design compromises, however, that the program was never successful. Several key members of IBM’s RISC team
         left in frustration, subsequently playing key roles in establishing the RISC chipmaker MIPS and Hewlett-Packard’s RISC chip
         business. These efforts were successful because, having accepted the attributes of the product for what they were, they found
         a market, in engineering workstations, that valued those attributes. IBM failed because it tried to force the technology into
         a market it had already found. Interestingly, IBM ultimately built a successful business around a RISC-architecture chip when
         it launched its own engineering workstation. See Charles Ferguson and Charles Morris, <em class="calibre2">Computer Wars</em> (New York: Time Books, 1994).

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_8"><a href="part0016_split_002.html#endnote_reference_8">8.</a> The notion that non-existent markets are best researched through action, rather than through passive observation, is explored
         in Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad, “Corporate Imagination and Expeditionary Marketing,” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, July-August, 1991, 81–92. 
      </p>
      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_9"><a href="part0016_split_002.html#endnote_reference_9">9.</a> The concept that business plans dealing with disruptive innovations should be plans for learning rather than plans for
         executing a preconceived strategy is taught clearly by Rita G. McGrath and Ian MacMillan in “Discovery-Driven Planning,” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, July-August, 1995, 44–54.

         gasoline-powered vehicles in the state must, in order to sell any cars at all, sell enough electric-powered vehicles to constitute
         2 percent of their total vehicle unit sales in the state. As already noted, the state government, in 1996, delayed implementation
         of that requirement until 2002.

         the disruptive technology; they are not intrinsic to electrically powered vehicles <em class="calibre2">per se.</em> Electric vehicles designed for different, lighter-duty applications, such as one by General Motors, have driving ranges of
         up to 100 miles. (See Jeffrey Thoresen Severts, “Managing Innovation: Electric Vehicle Development at Chrysler,” Harvard Business
         School student paper, 1996.)

         histories could not be squeezed into this book: tabletop photocopiers; surgical staplers; portable, transistorized radios
         and televisions; helican scan VCRs; microwave ovens; bubble jet printers. Each of these disruptive technologies has grown
         to dominate both its initial and its mainstream markets, having begun with simplicity and convenience as their primary value
         propositions.

         to muster the wherewithal to lead in extraordinarily complex and risky sustaining innovations, there is similar evidence from
         other industries; see, for example, Marco Iansiti, “Technology Integration: Managing Technological Evolution in a Complex
