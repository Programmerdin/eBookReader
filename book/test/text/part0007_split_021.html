      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_26"><a href="part0007_split_002.html#endnote_reference_26">3.</a> A few scholars have sought to measure the proportion of technological progress attributable to radical versus incremental
         advances. In an empirical study of a series of novel processes in petroleum refining, for example, John Enos found that half
         the economic benefits of new technology came from process improvements introduced after a new technology was commercially
         established. See J. L. Enos, “Invention and Innovation in the Petroleum Refining Industry,” in <em class="calibre2">The Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity: Economic and Social Factors</em>, National Bureau of Economic Research Report (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1962), 299–321. My study of the
         disk drive industry has shown the same result. Half the advance in areal density (megabits per square inch of disk surface)
         can be attributed to new component technologies and half to incremental improvements in existing components and refinements
         in system design. See Clayton M. Christensen, “Exploring the Limits of the Technology S-Curve,” <em class="calibre2">Production and Operations Management</em> (1), 1992, 334–366.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_27"><a href="part0007_split_002.html#endnote_reference_27">4.</a> See Kim B. Clark, “The Interaction of Design Hierarchies and Market Concepts in Technological Evolution,” <em class="calibre2">Research Policy</em> (14), 1985, 235–251. Clark suggests, for example, that the early selections by automotive engineers of gasoline over steam
         or electrically powered engines defined the technical agenda for subsequent generations of engineers, who consequently did
         not pursue refinements in electric or steam propulsion. Clark has thus shown that the design skills and technological knowledge
         resident in companies today result from the cumulative choices engineers have made of what to tackle versus what to leave
         alone. Clark posits that technological improvements requiring that companies build upon or extend an existing cumulative body
         of knowledge favor an industry’s established firms. Conversely, when changes require a completely different body of knowledge,
         established firms will be at a disadvantage compared to firms that had already accumulated a different hierarchically structured
         body of knowledge, most likely in another industry.

         <a id="page57"></a>See, for example, Michael L. Tushman and Philip Anderson, “Technological Discontinuities and Organizational Environments,”
         <em class="calibre2">Administrative Science Quarterly</em> (31), 1986, 439–465; and Philip Anderson and Michael Tushman, “Technological Discontinuities and Dominant Designs,” <em class="calibre2">Administrative Science Quarterly</em> (35), 1990, 604–633.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_29"><a href="part0007_split_003.html#endnote_reference_29">6.</a> The concept of <em class="calibre2">value network</em> builds on Giovanni Dosi’s concept of <em class="calibre2">technological paradigms.</em> See Giovanni Dosi, “Technological Paradigms and Technological Trajectories, <em class="calibre2">Research Policy</em> (11), 1982, 147–162. Dosi characterizes a technological paradigm as a “pattern of solution of selected technological problems,
         based on selected principles derived from natural sciences and on selected material technologies” (152). New paradigms represent
         discontinuities in trajectories of progress as defined within earlier paradigms. They tend to redefine the very meaning of
         progress, and point technologists toward new classes of problems as the targets of ensuing normal technology development.
         The question examined by Dosi—how new technologies are selected and retained—is closely related to the question of why firms
         succeed or fail as beneficiaries of such changes.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_30"><a href="part0007_split_003.html#endnote_reference_30">7.</a> Value network, as presented here, draws heavily on ideas I developed jointly with Professor Richard S. Rosenbloom and which
         are summarized in two journal articles: Clayton M. Christensen and Richard S. Rosenbloom, “Explaining the Attacker’s Advantage:
         The Technological Paradigms, Organizational Dynamics, and the Value Network,” <em class="calibre2">Research Policy</em> (24), 1995, 233–257; and Richard S. Rosenbloom and Clayton M. Christensen, “Technological Discontinuities, Organizational
         Capabilities, and Strategic Commitments,” <em class="calibre2">Industrial and Corporate Change</em> (3), 1994, 655–685. I am heavily indebted to Professor Rosenbloom for his contributions to the development of these perspectives.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_32"><a href="part0007_split_005.html#endnote_reference_32">9.</a> On this point, too, correspondence between the concept of the value network and Dosi’s concept of technological paradigms
         is strong. (See note 6.) The scope and boundaries of a value network are defined by the dominant technological paradigm and
         the corresponding technological trajectory employed at the higher levels of the network. As Dosi suggests, <em class="calibre2">value</em> can be defined as a function of the dominant technological paradigm in the ultimate system of use in the value network.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_36"><a href="part0007_split_007.html#endnote_reference_36">13.</a> The most widely read proponent of this view is Richard Foster; see, for example, his <em class="calibre2">Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage</em> (New York: Summit Books, 1986).

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_37"><a href="part0007_split_007.html#endnote_reference_37">14.</a> The insights summarized here are articulated more completely in C. M. Christensen, “Exploring the Limits of the Technology
         S-Curve,” <em class="calibre2">Production and Operations Management</em> (1), 1992, 334–366. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_38"><a href="part0007_split_008.html#endnote_reference_38">15.</a> A fuller account of similar decisions made in other firms can be found in Clayton M. Christensen, <em class="calibre2">The Innovator’s Challenge: Understanding the Influence of Market Environment on Processes of Technology Development in the
            Rigid Disk Drive Industry</em>, thesis, Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration, 1992.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_39"><a href="part0007_split_010.html#endnote_reference_39">16.</a> This procedure is consistent with Robert Burgelman’s observation that one of the greatest difficulties encountered by
         corporate entrepreneurs is in finding the right “beta test sites,” where products can be interactively developed and refined
         with customers. Generally, the entrée to the customer was provided by the salesperson who sold the firm’s established product
         lines. This helped the firm develop new products for established markets, but not identify new applications for its new technology.
         See Robert Burgelman and Leonard Sayles, <em class="calibre2">Inside Corporate Innovation</em> (New York: The Free Press, 1986) 76–80. Professor Rebecca Henderson pointed out to me that this tendency always to take new
         technologies to mainstream customers reflects a rather narrow <em class="calibre2">marketing</em> competence—that although many scholars tend to frame the issue as one of technological competence, such inability to find
         new markets for new technologies may be a firm’s most serious handicap in innovation.

         they were new to Seagate. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_41"><a href="part0007_split_011.html#endnote_reference_41">18.</a> This is consistent with the findings reported by Arnold Cooper and Dan Schendel in “Strategic Responses to Technological
         Threats,” <em class="calibre2">Business Horizons</em> (19), February, 1976, 61–69.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_42"><a href="part0007_split_012.html#endnote_reference_42">19.</a> Ultimately, nearly all North American disk drive manufacturers can trace their founders’ genealogy to IBM’s San Jose division,
         which developed and manufactured its magnetic recording products. See Clayton M. Christensen, “The Rigid Disk Drive Industry: A History of Commercial and Technological Turbulence,” <em class="calibre2">Business History Review</em> (67), Winter, 1993, 531–588.
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_43"><a href="part0007_split_013.html#endnote_reference_43">20.</a> In general, these component technologies were developed within the largest of the established firms that dominated the
         established markets above these entrants. This is because new components generally (but not always) have 
         <a id="page59"></a>a sustaining impact on technology trajectories. These high-end, established firms typically were engaged in the hottest pursuit
         of sustaining innovations. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_44"><a href="part0007_split_014.html#endnote_reference_44">21.</a> The research of Eric von Hippel, frequently cited as evidence of the value of listening to customers, indicates that customers
         originate a large majority of new product ideas (see Eric von Hippel, <em class="calibre2">The Sources of Innovation</em> [New York: Oxford University Press, 1988]). One fruitful avenue for future research would be to revisit von Hippel’s data
         in light of the framework presented here. The value network framework would predict that the innovations toward which the
         customers in von Hippel’s study led their suppliers would have been sustaining innovations. We would expect disruptive innovations
         to have come from other sources. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_45"><a href="part0007_split_014.html#endnote_reference_45">22.</a> Henderson saw similar potential danger for being misled by customers in her study of photolithographic aligner equipment
         manufacturers. See Rebecca M. Henderson, “Keeping Too Close to Your Customers,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan
         School of Management working paper, 1993.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_46"><a href="part0007_split_019.html#endnote_reference_46">23.</a> Many industry observers have noted that there seems to be a floor on the cost of making a disk drive, somewhere around
         $120 per device, below which even the best manufacturers cannot plunge. This is the basic cost of designing, producing, and
         assembling the requisite components. Drive makers keep reducing costs per megabyte by continuously increasing the number of
         megabytes available in that basic $120 box. The effect of this floor on the competition between disk drives and flash cards
         may be profound. It means that in low-capacity applications, as the price of flash memory falls, flash will become cost-competitive
         with disk memory. The frontier above which magnetic disk drives have lower costs per megabyte than flash will keep moving
         upmarket, in a manner perfectly analogous to the upmarket movement of larger disk drive architectures. Experts predicted,
         in fact, that by 1997, a 40 MB flash card would be priced comparably to a 40 MB disk drive.
