      <p class="p">Although entrants led in <em class="calibre2">commercializing</em> disruptive technologies, their development was often the work of engineers at established firms, using bootlegged resources.
         Rarely initiated by senior management, these architecturally innovative designs almost always employed off-the-shelf components.
         Thus, engineers at Seagate Technology, the leading 5.25-inch drive maker, were, in 1985, the second in the industry to develop
         working prototypes of 3.5-inch models. They made some eighty prototype models before the issue of formal project approval
         was raised with senior management. The same thing happened earlier at Control Data and Memorex, the dominant 14-inch drive
         makers, where engineers had designed working 8-inch drives internally, nearly two years before the product appeared in the
         market.
