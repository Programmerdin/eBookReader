<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_3">HONDA’S INVASION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MOTORCYCLE INDUSTRY</h1>
      <p class="p">Honda’s success in attacking and dominating the North American and European motorcycle markets has been cited as a superb
         example of clear strategic thinking coupled with aggressive and coherent execution. According to these accounts, Honda employed
         a deliberate manufacturing strategy based on an experience curve in which it cut prices, built volume, aggressively reduced
         costs, cut prices some more, reduced costs further, 
         <a id="page150"></a>and built an unassailable volume-based low-cost manufacturing position in the motorcycle market. Honda then used that base
         to move upmarket and ultimately blew all established motorcycle manufacturers out of the market except for Harley-Davidson
         and BMW, which barely survived.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0013_split_009.html#endnote_text_2">2</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_2"></a> Honda combined this manufacturing triumph with a clever product design, catchy advertising, and a convenient, broad-based
         distributor/retailer network tailored to the informal cyclists who constituted Honda’s core customer base. Told in this manner,
         Honda’s history is a tale of strategic brilliance and operational excellence that all managers dream will be told about them
         someday. The reality of Honda’s achievement, as recounted by the Honda employees who were managing the business at the time,
         however, is quite different.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">During Japan’s years of post-war reconstruction and poverty, Honda had emerged as a supplier of small, rugged motorized bicycles
         that were used by distributors and retailers in congested urban areas to make small deliveries to local customers. Honda developed
         considerable expertise in designing small, efficient engines for these bikes. Its Japanese market sales grew from an initial
         annual volume of 1,200 units in 1949 to 285,000 units in 1959.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Honda’s executives were eager to exploit the company’s low labor costs to export motorbikes to North America, but there was
         no equivalent market there for its popular Japanese “Supercub” delivery bike. Honda’s research showed that Americans used
         motorcyles primarily for over-the-road distance driving in which size, power, and speed were the most highly valued product
         attributes. Accordingly, Honda engineers designed a fast, powerful motorcycle specifically for the American market, and in
         1959 Honda dispatched three employees to Los Angeles to begin marketing efforts. To save living expenses, the three shared
         an apartment, and each brought with him a Supercub bike to provide cheap transportation around the city.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The venture was a frustrating experience from the beginning. Honda’s products offered no advantage to prospective customers
         other than cost, and most motorcycle dealers refused to accept the unproven product line. When the team finally succeeded
         in finding some dealers and selling a few hundred units, the results were disastrous. Honda’s understanding of engine design
         turned out not to be transferable to highway applications, in which bikes were driven at high speeds for extended periods:
         The engines sprung oil leaks and the clutches wore out. Honda’s expenses in air-freighting the warrantied replacement motorcycles
         between Japan and Los Angeles nearly sunk the company.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page151"></a>Meanwhile, one Saturday, Kihachiro Kawashima, the Honda executive in charge of the North American venture, decided to vent
         his frustrations by taking his Supercub into the hills east of Los Angeles. It helped: He felt better after zipping around
         in the dirt. A few weeks later he sought relief dirt-biking again. Eventually he invited his two colleagues to join him on
         their Supercubs. Their neighbors and others who saw them zipping around the hills began inquiring where they could buy those
         cute little bikes, and the trio obliged by special-ordering Supercub models for them from Japan. This private use of what
         became known as off-road dirt bikes continued for a couple of years. At one point a Sears buyer tried to order Supercubs for
         the company’s outdoor power equipment departments, but Honda ignored the opportunity, preferring to focus on selling large,
         powerful, over-the-road cycles, a strategy that continued to be unsuccessful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Finally, as more and more people clamored for their own little Honda Supercubs to join their dirt-biking friends, the potential
         for a very different market dawned on Honda’s U.S. team: Maybe there was an undeveloped off-the-road recreational motorbike
         market in North America for which— quite by accident—the company’s little 50cc Supercub was nicely suited. Although it took
         much arguing and arm-twisting, the Los Angeles team ultimately convinced corporate management in Japan that while the company’s
         large bike strategy was doomed to failure, another quite different opportunity to create a totally new market segment merited
         pursuit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Once the small-bike strategy was formally adopted, the team found that securing dealers for the Supercub was an even more
         vexing challenge than it had been for its big bikes. There just weren’t any retailers selling that class of product. Ultimately,
         Honda persuaded a few sporting goods dealers to take on its line of motorbikes, and as they began to promote the bikes successfully,
         Honda’s innovative distribution strategy was born.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Honda had no money for a sophisticated advertising campaign. But a UCLA student who had gone dirt-biking with his friends
         came up with the advertising slogan, “You meet the nicest people on a Honda,” for a paper he wrote in an advertising course.
         Encouraged by his teacher, he sold the idea to an advertising agency, which then convinced Honda to use it in what became
         an award-winning advertising campaign. These serendipitous events were, of course, followed by truly world-class design engineering
         and manufacturing execution, which enabled Honda to repeatedly lower its prices as it improved its product quality and increased
         its production volumes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Honda’s 50cc motorbike was a disruptive technology in the North American market. The rank-ordering of product attributes that
         Honda’s 
         <a id="page152"></a>customers employed in their product decision making defined for Honda a very different value network than the established
         network in which Harley-Davidson, BMW, and other traditional motorcycle makers had competed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">From its low-cost manufacturing base for reliable motorbikes, using a strategy reminiscent of the upmarket invasions described
         earlier in disk drives, steel, excavators, and retailing, Honda turned its sights upmarket, introducing between 1970 and 1988
         a series of bikes with progressively more powerful engines.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">For a time in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Harley attempted to compete head-on with Honda and to capitalize on the expanding
         lowend market by producing a line of small-engine (150 to 300 cc) bikes acquired from the Italian motorcycle maker Aeromecchania.
         Harley attempted to sell the bikes through its North American dealer network. Although Honda’s manufacturing prowess clearly
         disadvantaged Harley in this effort, a primary cause of Harley’s failure to establish a strong presence in the small-bike
         value network was the opposition of its dealer network. Their profit margins were far greater on high-end bikes, and many
         of them felt the small machines compromised Harley-Davidson’s image with their core customers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Recall from <a href="part0007_split_000.html">chapter 2</a> the finding that within a given value network, the disk drive companies and their computer-manufacturing
         customers had developed very similar economic models or cost structures, which determined the sorts of business that appeared
         profitable to them. We see the same phenomenon here. Within their value network, the economics of Harley’s dealers drove them
         to favor the same type of business that Harley had come to favor. Their coexistence within the value network made it difficult
         for either Harley or its dealers to exit the network through its bottom. In the late 1970s Harley gave in and repositioned
         itself at the very high end of the motorcycle market—a strategy reminiscent of Seagate’s repositioning in disk drives, and
         of the upmarket retreats of the cable excavator companies and the integrated steel mills.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Interestingly, Honda proved just as inaccurate in estimating <em class="calibre2">how large</em> the potential North American motorcycle market was as it had been in understanding <em class="calibre2">what</em> it was. Its initial aspirations upon entry in 1959 had been to capture 10 percent of a market estimated at 550,000 units
         per year with annual growth of 5 percent. By 1975 the market had grown 16 percent per year to 5,000,000 annual units—units
         that came largely from an application that Honda could not have foreseen.
