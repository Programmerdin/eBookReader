         drives were turned on simultaneously and operated continuously for one hour, one of those drives would fail within the first
         hour.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_2"><a href="part0015_split_003.html#endnote_reference_2">2.</a> Three of the earliest and most influential papers that proposed the existence of product life cycles were Jay W. Forrester,
         “Industrial Dynamics,” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, July–August, 1958, 9–14; Arch Patton, “Stretch Your Products’ Earning Years—Top Management’s Stake in the Product Life Cycle,”
         <em class="calibre2">Management Review</em> (38), June, 1959, 67–79; and William E. Cox, “Product Life Cycles as Marketing Models,” <em class="calibre2">Journal of Business</em> (40), October, 1967, 375. Papers summarizing the conceptual and empirical problems surrounding the product life cycle concept
         include Nariman K. Dhalla and Sonia Yuspeh, “Forget the Product Life Cycle Concept!” <em class="calibre2">Harvard Business Review</em>, January–February, 1976, 102–112; David R. Rink and John E. Swan, “Product Life Cycle Research: A Literature Review,” <em class="calibre2">Journal of Business Research</em>, 1979, 219; and George S. Day, “The Product Life Cycle: Analysis and Applications Issues,” <em class="calibre2">Journal of Marketing</em> (45), Fall, 1981, 60–67. A paper by Gerard J. Tellis and C. Merle Crawford, “An Evolutionary Approach to Product Growth Theory,”
         <em class="calibre2">Journal of Marketing</em> (45), Fall, 1981, 125–132, contains a cogent critique of the product life cycle concept, and presents a theory of product
         evolution that presages many of the ideas presented in this section.

         took up residence in an inexpensive New York City hotel in order to negotiate a license to AT&amp;T’s patented transistor technology,
         which its scientists had invented in 1947. Morita found AT&amp;T to be a less-than-willing negotiator and had to visit the company
         repeatedly badgering AT&amp;T to grant the license. Finally AT&amp;T relented. After the meeting ended in which the licensing documents
         were signed, an AT&amp;T official asked Morita what Sony planned to do with the license. “We will build small radios,” Morita
         replied. “Why would anyone care about smaller radios?” the official queried. “We’ll see,” was Morita’s answer. Several months
         later Sony introduced to the U.S. market the first 
         <a id="page202"></a>portable transistor radio. According to the dominant metrics of radio performance in the mainstream market, these early transistor
         radios were really bad, offering far lower fidelity and much more static than the vacuum tube–based tabletop radios that were
         the dominant design of the time. But rather than work in his labs until his transistor radios were performance-competitive
         in the major market (which is what most of the leading electronics companies did with transistor technology), Morita instead
         found a market that valued the attributes of the technology as it existed at the time—the portable personal radio. Not surprisingly,
         none of the leading makers of table-top radios became a leading producer of portable radios, and all were subsequently driven
         from the radio market. (This story was recounted to me by Dr. Sheldon Weinig, retired vice chairman for manufacturing and
         technology of Sony Corporation.)

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_7"><a href="part0015_split_007.html#endnote_reference_7">7.</a> Cook recounts that in the process of designing a simple and convenient accounting software package, Intuit’s developers
         arrived at a profound insight. The double-entry accounting system originally developed by Venetian merchants to catch arithmetical
         mistakes continued to be used in every available package of accounting software—even though computers typically do not make
         mistakes in addition and subtraction. Intuit was able to greatly simplify its product by eliminating this unneeded dimension
         of product functionality.

         Lilly was not able to achieve premium pricing for its Humulin insulin, it benefited from the investment. Humulin protected
         Lilly against a possible shortfall in the pancreas supply, threatened by declining red meat consumption, and it gave Lilly
         a very valuable experience and asset base in the volume manufacturing of bioengineered drugs.

         as among the best-managed and most successful in the world may have overshot what their mainstream markets demand. Intel,
         for example, has always measured the speed of its microprocessors on the vertical axis of its performance graphs. It has always
         assumed that the market demands ever-faster microprocessors, and evidence to the tune of billions of dollars in profit has
         certainly confirmed that belief. Certainly some leading-edge customers need chips that process instructions at rates of 200,
         400, and 800 MHz. But what about the mainstream market? Is it possible that sometime soon the speed and cost of Intel’s new
         microprocessors might 
         <a id="page203"></a>overshoot market demands? And if technology oversupply is possible, how will thousands of Intel employees be able to recognize
         when this has occurred, accepting the change with enough conviction to completely alter the trajectory of their development
         efforts? Discerning technology oversupply is difficult. Doing something about it is even more so.
