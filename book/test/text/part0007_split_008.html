<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_8">MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING AND DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE</h1>
      <p class="p">
         <a id="page42"></a>Competition within the value networks in which companies are embedded defines in many ways how the firms can earn their money.
         The network defines the customers’ problems to be addressed by the firm’s products and services and how much can be paid for
         solving them. Competition and customer demands in the value network in many ways shape the firms’ cost structure, the firm
         size required to remain competitive, and the necessary rate of growth. Thus, managerial decisions that make sense for companies
         outside a value network may make no sense at all for those within it, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">We saw, in <a href="part0006_split_000.html">chapter 1</a>, a stunningly consistent pattern of successful implementation of sustaining innovations by established
         firms and their failure to deal with disruptive ones. The pattern was consistent because the managerial decisions that led
         to those outcomes made sense. Good managers do what makes sense, and what makes sense is primarily shaped by their value network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This decision-making pattern, outlined in the six steps below, emerged from my interviews with more than eighty managers who
         played key roles in the disk drive industry’s leading firms, both incumbents and entrants, at times when disruptive technologies
         had emerged. In these interviews I tried to reconstruct, as accurately and from as many points of view as possible, the forces
         that influenced these firms’ decision-making processes regarding the development and commercialization of technologies either
         relevant or irrelevant to the value networks in which the firms were at the time embedded. My findings consistently showed
         that established firms confronted with disruptive technology change did not have trouble developing the requisite <em class="calibre2">technology:</em> Prototypes of the new drives had often been developed before management was asked to make a decision. Rather, disruptive
         projects stalled when it came to allocating scarce resources among competing product and technology development proposals
         (allocating resources between the two value networks shown at right and 
         <a id="page43"></a>left in Figure 2.6, for example). Sustaining projects addressing the needs of the firms’ most powerful customers (the new
         waves of technology within the value network depicted in Figure 2.5) <em class="calibre2">almost always</em> preempted resources from disruptive technologies with small markets and poorly defined customer needs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This characteristic pattern of decisions is summarized in the following pages. Because the experience was so archetypical,
         the struggle of Seagate Technology, the industry’s dominant maker of 5.25-inch drives, to successfully commercialize the disruptive
         3.5-inch drive is recounted in detail to illustrate each of the steps in the pattern.
