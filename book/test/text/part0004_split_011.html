      <p class="p">Sound market research and good planning followed by execution according to plan are hallmarks of good management. When applied
         to sustaining technological innovation, these practices are invaluable; they are the primary reason, in fact, why established
         firms led in every single instance of sustaining innovation in the history of the disk drive industry. Such reasoned approaches
         are feasible in dealing with sustaining technology because the size and growth rates of the markets are generally known, trajectories
         of technological progress have been established, and the needs of leading customers have usually been well articulated. Because
         the vast majority of innovations are sustaining in character, most executives have learned to manage innovation in a sustaining
         context, where analysis and planning were feasible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In dealing with disruptive technologies leading to new markets, however, market researchers and business planners have consistently
         dismal records. In fact, based upon the evidence from the disk drive, motorcycle, and microprocessor industries, reviewed
         in <a href="part0013_split_000.html">chapter 7</a>, the only thing we may know for sure when we read experts’ forecasts about how large emerging markets will become
         is that they are wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In many instances, leadership in sustaining innovations—about which information is known and for which plans can be made—is
         not competitively important. In such cases, technology followers do about as well as 
         <a id="pagexxii"></a>technology leaders. It is in disruptive innovations, where we know least about the market, that there are such strong first-mover
         advantages. This is the innovator’s dilemma.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Companies whose investment processes demand quantification of market sizes and financial returns before they can enter a market
         get paralyzed or make serious mistakes when faced with disruptive technologies. They demand market data when none exists and
         make judgments based upon financial projections when neither revenues or costs can, in fact, be known. Using planning and
         marketing techniques that were developed to manage sustaining technologies in the very different context of disruptive ones
         is an exercise in flapping wings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><a href="part0013_split_000.html">Chapter 7</a> discusses a different approach to strategy and planning that recognizes the law that the right markets, and the
         right strategy for exploiting them, cannot be known in advance. Called discovery-based planning, it suggests that managers
         assume that forecasts are wrong, rather than right, and that the strategy they have chosen to pursue may likewise be wrong.
         Investing and managing under such assumptions drives managers to develop plans for learning what needs to be known, a much
         more effective way to confront disruptive technologies successfully.
