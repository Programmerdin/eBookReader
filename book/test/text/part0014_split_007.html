<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_7"><em class="calibre2">A case in point: Did Digital Equipment have the capability to succeed in personal computers?</em></h2>
      <p class="p">Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was a spectacularly successful maker of minicomputers from the 1960s through the 1980s.
         One might have been tempted to assert, when the personal computer market began to coalesce in the early 1980s, that DEC’s
         “core competence” was in building computers. But if computers were DEC’s competence, why did the company stumble?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Clearly, DEC had the <em class="calibre2">resources</em> to succeed in personal computers. Its engineers were routinely designing far more sophisticated computers than PCs. DEC had
         plenty of cash, a great brand, and strong technology. But did DEC have the <em class="calibre2">processes</em> to succeed in the personal computer business? No. The processes for designing and manufacturing minicomputers involved designing
         many of the key components of the computer internally and then integrating the components into proprietary configurations.
         The design process itself consumed two to three years for a new product model. DEC’s manufacturing processes entailed making
         most components and assembling them in a batch mode. It sold direct to corporate engineering organizations. These processes
         worked extremely well in the minicomputer business.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The personal computer business, in contrast, required processes through which the most cost-effective components were outsourced
         from the best suppliers around the globe. New computer designs, comprised of modular components, had to be completed in six-to
         twelve-month cycles. The computers were manufactured in high-volume assembly lines, and sold through retailers to consumers
         and businesses. None of these processes required to compete successfully in the personal computer business existed within
         DEC. In other words, although the <em class="calibre2">people</em> working at DEC, as individuals, had the abilities to design, build, and sell personal computers profitably, they were working
         in an organization that was incapable of doing this because its processes had been designed and had evolved to 
         <a id="page171"></a>do <em class="calibre2">other</em> tasks well. The very processes that made the company capable of succeeding in one business rendered it incapable of succeeding
         in another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">And what about DEC’s <em class="calibre2">values</em>? Because of the overhead costs that were required to succeed in the minicomputer business, DEC had to adopt a set of values
         that essentially dictated, “If it generates 50 percent gross margins or more, it’s good business. If it generates less than
         40 percent margins, it’s not worth doing.” Management had to ensure that all employees prioritized projects according to this
         criterion, or the company couldn’t make money. Because personal computers generated lower margins, they did not “fit” with
         DEC’s values. The company’s criteria for prioritization placed higher-performance minicomputers ahead of personal computers
         in the resource allocation process. And any attempts that the company made to enter the personal computer business had to
         target the highest-margin tiers of that market—because the financial results that might be earned in those tiers were the
         only ones that the company’s values would tolerate. But because of the patterns noted in <a href="part0009_split_000.html">chapter 4</a>—the strong tendency for
         competitors with low-overhead business models to migrate upmarket—Digital’s values rendered it incapable of pursuing a winning
         strategy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As we saw in <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapter 5</a>, Digital Equipment could have owned <em class="calibre2">another</em> organization whose processes and values were tailored to those required to play in the personal computer game. But the particular
         organization in Maynard, Massachusetts, whose extraordinary capabilities had carried the company to such success in the minicomputer
         business, was simply incapable of succeeding in the personal computer world.
