<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_5">WHAT SHOULD BE OUR PRODUCT, TECHNOLOGY, AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGIES?</h1>
      <h2 class="calibre24"><em class="calibre2">Product Development for Disruptive Innovations</em></h2>
      <p class="p">
         <a id="page213"></a>Guiding my engineers in designing our initial electric vehicle will be a challenge, because of the classic chicken-and-egg
         problem: Without a market, there is no obvious or reliable source of customer input; without a product that addresses customers’
         needs, there can be no market. How can we design a product in such a vacuum? Fortunately, the principles described in this
         book give us some help.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The most valuable guidance comes from <a href="part0015_split_000.html">chapter 9</a>, which indicated that the basis of competition will change over a product’s
         life cycle and that the cycle of evolution itself is driven by the phenomenon of performance oversupply, that is, the condition
         in which the performance provided by a technology exceeds the actual needs of the market. Historically, performance oversupply
         opens the door for simpler, less expensive, and more convenient—and almost always disruptive—technologies to enter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Performance oversupply indeed seems to have occurred in autos. There are practical limits to the size of auto bodies and engines,
         to the value of going from 0 to 60 in fewer seconds, and to the consumer’s ability to cope with overchoice in available options.
         Thus, we can safely predict that the basis of product competition and customer choice will shift away from these measures
         of functionality toward other attributes, such as reliability and convenience. This is borne out by the nature of the most
         successful entrants into the North American market during the past thirty years; they have succeeded not because they introduced
         products with superior functionality, but because they competed on the basis of reliability and convenience.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Toyota, for example, entered the U.S. market with its simple, reliable Corona, establishing a low-end market position. Then,
         consistent with the inexorable attraction to migrate upmarket, Toyota introduced models, such as Camry, Previa, and Lexus,
         with added features and functionality, creating a vacuum at the low end of the market into which entrants such as Saturn and
         Hyundai have entered. Saturn’s strategy has been to characterize the customer’s entire experience of buying and owning the
         vehicle as reliable and convenient, but it, too, judging by recent reports,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_15">15</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_15"></a> will soon take its turn moving upmarket, creating a new vacuum at the low end for even simpler, more convenient transportation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page214"></a>In all likelihood, therefore, the winning design in the first stages of the electric vehicle race will be characterized by
         simplicity and convenience and will be incubated in an emerging value network in which these attributes are important measures
         of value. Each of the disruptive technologies studied in this book has been smaller, simpler, and more convenient than preceding
         products. Each was initially used in a new value network in which simplicity and convenience were valued. This was true for
         smaller, simpler disk drives; desktop and portable computers; hydraulic backhoes; steel minimills as opposed to integrated
         mills; insulin-injecting pens as opposed to syringes.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_16">16</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_16"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Using these qualities as my guiding principles, I would instruct my design engineers to proceed according to the following
         three criteria.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">First, this vehicle must be <em class="calibre2">simple, reliable, and convenient.</em> That probably means, for example, that figuring out a way to recharge its batteries quickly, using the commonly available
         electrical service, would be an immutable technological objective.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Second, because no one knows the ultimate market for the product or how it will ultimately be used, we must design a product
         platform in which <em class="calibre2">feature, function, and styling changes can be made quickly and at low cost.</em> Assuming, for example, that the initial customers for electric vehicles will be parents who buy them for their teenaged children
         to drive to and from school, friends’ homes, and activities, the first model would have features and styling appropriate and
         appealing to teenagers. But, although we may target this market first, there’s a high probability that our initial concept
         will prove wrong. So we’ve got to get the first models done fast and on a shoestring—leaving ample budget to get it right
         once feedback from the market starts coming in.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_17">17</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_17"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Third, we must <em class="calibre2">hit a low price point.</em> Disruptive technologies typically have a lower <em class="calibre2">sticker</em> price per unit than products that are used in the mainstream, even though their cost in use is often higher. What enabled
         the use of disk drives in desktop computers was not just their smaller size; it was their low unit price, which fit within
         the overall price points that personal computer makers needed to hit. The price <em class="calibre2">per megabyte</em> of the smaller disk drives was always higher than for the larger drives. Similarly, in excavators the price <em class="calibre2">per excavator</em> was lower for the early hydraulic models than for the established cable-actuated ones, but their total cost per cubic yard
         of earth moved per hour was much higher. Accordingly, our electric vehicle must have a lower sticker price than the 
         <a id="page215"></a>prevailing price for gasoline-powered cars, even if the operating cost per mile driven is higher. Customers have a long track
         record of paying price premiums for convenience.
