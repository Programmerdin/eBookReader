<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_4">INTEL’S DISCOVERY OF THE MICROPROCESSOR MARKET</h1>
      <p class="p">
         <a id="page153"></a>Intel Corporation, whose founders launched the company in 1969 based on their pioneering development of metal-on-silicon (MOS)
         technology to produce the world’s first dynamic random access memory (DRAM) integrated circuits, had become by 1995 one of
         the world’s most profitable major companies. Its storied success is even more remarkable because, when its initial leadership
         position in the DRAM market began crumbling between 1978 and 1986 under the onslaught of Japanese semiconductor manufacturers,
         Intel transformed itself from a second-tier DRAM company into the world’s dominant microprocessor manufacturer. How did Intel
         do it?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Intel developed the original microprocessor under a contract development arrangement with a Japanese calculator manufacturer.
         When the project was over, Intel’s engineering team persuaded company executives to purchase the microprocessor patent from
         the calculator maker, which owned it under the terms of its contract with Intel. Intel had no explicit strategy for building
         a market for this new microprocessor; the company simply sold the chip to whoever seemed to be able to use it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Mainstream as they seem today, microprocessors were disruptive technologies when they first emerged. They were capable only
         of limited functionality, compared to the complex logic circuits that constituted the central processing units of large computers
         in the 1960s. But they were small and simple, and they enabled affordable logic and computation in applications where this
         previously had not been feasible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Through the 1970s, as competition in the DRAM market intensified, margins began to decline on Intel’s DRAM revenues while
         margins on its microprocessor product line, where there was less competition, stayed robust. Intel’s system for allocating
         production capacity operated according to a formula whereby capacity was committed in proportion to the gross margins earned
         by each product line. The system therefore imperceptibly began diverting investment capital and manufacturing capacity away
         from the DRAM business and into microprocessors—without an explicit management decision to do so.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0013_split_009.html#endnote_text_5">5</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_5"></a> In fact, Intel senior management continued to focus most of its own attention and energy on DRAM, even while the company’s
         resource allocation processes were gradually implementing an exit from that business.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This de facto strategy shift, driven by Intel’s autonomously operating resource allocation process, was fortuitous. Because
         so little was known 
         <a id="page154"></a>of the microprocessor market at that time, explicit analysis would have provided little justification for a bold move into
         microprocessors. Gordon Moore, Intel co-founder and chairman, for example, recalled that IBM’s choice of the Intel 8088 microprocessor
         as the “brain” of its new personal computer was viewed within Intel as a “small design win.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0013_split_009.html#endnote_text_6">6</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_6"></a> Even after IBM’s stunning success with its personal computers, Intel’s internal forecast of the potential applications for
         the company’s next-generation 286 chip did not include personal computers in its list of the fifty highest-volume applications.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0013_split_009.html#endnote_text_7">7</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_7"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In retrospect, the application of microprocessors to personal computers is an obvious match. But in the heat of the battle,
         of the many applications in which microprocessors might have been used, even a management team as astute as Intel’s could
         not know which would emerge as the most important and what volumes and profits it would yield.
