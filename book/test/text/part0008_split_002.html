<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_2">THE IMPACT OF DISRUPTIVE HYDRAULICS TECHNOLOGY</h1>
      <p class="p">The next major technological change precipitated widespread failure in the industry. Beginning shortly after World War II
         and continuing through the late 1960s, while the dominant source of power remained the diesel engine, a new mechanism emerged
         for extending and lifting the bucket: hydraulically actuated systems replaced the cable-actuated systems. Only four of the
         thirty or so established manufacturers of cable-actuated equipment in business in the 1950s (Insley, Koehring, Little Giant,
         and Link Belt) had successfully transformed themselves into sustainable hydraulic excavator manufacturers by the 1970s. A
         few others survived by withdrawing into making such equipment as huge, cable-actuated draglines for strip mining and dredging.

         <a id="endnote_reference_53"></a> Most of the others failed. The firms that overran the excavation equipment industry at this point were all entrants into
         the hydraulics generation: J. I. Case, John Deere, Drott, Ford, J. C. Bamford, Poclain, International Harvester, Caterpillar,
         O &amp; K, Demag, Leibherr, Komatsu, and Hitachi.
