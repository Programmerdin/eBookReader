<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_5">UNPREDICTABILITY AND DOWNWARD IMMOBILITY IN ESTABLISHED FIRMS</h1>
      <p class="p">The reaction of some managers to the difficulty of correctly planning the markets for disruptive technologies is to work harder
         and plan smarter. While this approach works for sustaining innovations, it denies the evidence about the nature of disruptive
         ones. Amid all the uncertainty surrounding disruptive technologies, managers can always count on one anchor: <em class="calibre2">Experts’ forecasts will always be wrong.</em> It is simply impossible to predict with any useful degree of precision how disruptive products will be used or how large
         their markets will be. An important corollary is that, because markets for disruptive technologies are unpredictable, companies’
         initial strategies for entering these markets will generally be wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">How does this statement square with the findings presented in Table 6.1, which showed a stunning difference in the posterior
         probabilities of success between firms that entered new, emerging value networks (37 percent) and those that entered existing
         value networks (6 percent)? If markets cannot be predicted in advance, how can firms that target them be more successful?
         Indeed, when I have shown the matrix in Table 6.1 to managerial audiences, they are quite astonished by the differences in
         the magnitudes and probabilities of success. But it is clear that the managers don’t believe that the results can be generalized
         to their own situations. 
         <a id="page155"></a>The findings violate their intuitive sense that creating new markets is a genuinely risky business.
