      <p class="p">
         <a id="pageix"></a>This book is about the failure of companies to stay atop their industries when they confront certain types of market and technological
         change. It’s not about the failure of simply any company, but of <em class="calibre2">good</em> companies—the kinds that many managers have admired and tried to emulate, the companies known for their abilities to innovate
         and execute. Companies stumble for many reasons, of course, among them bureaucracy, arrogance, tired executive blood, poor
         planning, short-term investment horizons, inadequate skills and resources, and just plain bad luck. But this book is not about
         companies with such weaknesses: It is about well-managed companies that have their competitive antennae up, listen astutely
         to their customers, invest aggressively in new technologies, and yet still lose market dominance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Such seemingly unaccountable failures happen in industries that move fast and in those that move slow; in those built on electronics
         technology and those built on chemical and mechanical technology; in manufacturing and in service industries. Sears Roebuck,
         for example, was regarded for decades as one of the most astutely managed retailers in the world. At its zenith Sears accounted
         for more than 2 percent of all retail sales in the United States. It pioneered several innovations critical to the success
         of today’s most admired retailers: for example, supply chain management, store brands, catalogue retailing, and credit card
         sales. The esteem in which Sears’ management was held shows in this 1964 excerpt from <em class="calibre2">Fortune:</em> “How did Sears do it? In a way, the most arresting aspect of its 
         <a id="pagex"></a>story is that there was no gimmick. Sears opened no big bag of tricks, shot off no skyrockets. Instead, it looked as though
         everybody in its organization simply did the right thing, easily and naturally. And their cumulative effect was to create
         an extraordinary powerhouse of a company.”
<sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0004_split_016.html#endnote_text_1">1</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_1"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Yet no one speaks about Sears that way today. Somehow, it completely missed the advent of discount retailing and home centers.
         In the midst of today’s catalogue retailing boom, Sears has been driven from that business. Indeed, the very viability of
         its retailing operations has been questioned. One commentator has noted that “Sears’ Merchandise Group lost $1.3 billion (in
         1992) even before a $1.7 billion restructuring charge. Sears let arrogance blind it to basic changes taking place in the American
         marketplace.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0004_split_016.html#endnote_text_2">2</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_2"></a> Another writer has complained,
      </p>
      <p class="ext">Sears has been a disappointment for investors who have watched its stock sink dismally in the face of unkept promises of a
         turnaround. Sears’ old merchandising approach—a vast, middle-of-the-road array of mid-priced goods and services—is no longer
         competitive. No question, the constant disappointments, the repeated predictions of a turnaround that never seems to come,
         have reduced the credibility of Sears’ management in both the financial and merchandising communities.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0004_split_016.html#endnote_text_3">3</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_3"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="spb">It is striking to note that Sears received its accolades at exactly the time—in the mid-1960s—when it was ignoring the rise
         of discount retailing and home centers, the lower-cost formats for marketing name-brand hard goods that ultimately stripped
         Sears of its core franchise. Sears was praised as one of the best-managed companies in the world at the very time it let Visa
         and MasterCard usurp the enormous lead it had established in the use of credit cards in retailing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In some industries this pattern of leadership failure has been repeated more than once. Consider the computer industry. IBM
         dominated the mainframe market but missed by years the emergence of minicomputers, which were technologically much simpler
         than mainframes. In fact, no other major manufacturer of mainframe computers became a significant player in the minicomputer
         business. Digital Equipment Corporation created the minicomputer market and was joined by a set of other aggressively managed
         companies: Data General, Prime, Wang, Hewlett-Packard, and Nixdorf. But each of these companies in turn missed the desktop
         personal computer market. It was left to Apple Computer, together with Commodore, Tandy, and IBM’s stand-alone PC division,
         to create the personal-computing market. Apple, in particular, was uniquely innovative 
         <a id="pagexi"></a>in establishing the standard for user-friendly computing. But Apple and IBM lagged five years behind the leaders in bringing
         portable computers to market. Similarly, the firms that built the engineering workstation market—Apollo, Sun, and Silicon
         Graphics—were all newcomers to the industry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As in retailing, many of these leading computer manufacturers were at one time regarded as among the best-managed companies
         in the world and were held up by journalists and scholars of management as examples for all to follow. Consider this assessment
         of Digital Equipment, made in 1986: “Taking on Digital Equipment Corp. these days is like standing in front of a moving train.
         The $7.6 billion computer maker has been gathering speed while most rivals are stalled in a slump in the computer industry.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0004_split_016.html#endnote_text_4">4</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_4"></a> The author proceeded to warn IBM to watch out, because it was standing on the tracks. Indeed, Digital was one of the most
         prominently featured companies in the McKinsey study that led to the book <em class="calibre2">In Search of Excellence.</em><sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0004_split_016.html#endnote_text_5">5</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_5"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Yet a few years later, writers characterized DEC quite differently:</p>
      <p class="ext">Digital Equipment Corporation is a company in need of triage. Sales are drying up in its key minicomputer line. A two-year-old
         restructuring plan has failed miserably. Forecasting and production planning systems have failed miserably. Cost-cutting hasn’t
         come close to restoring profitability…. But the real misfortune may be DEC’s lost opportunities. It has squandered two years
         trying halfway measures to respond to the low-margin personal computers and workstations that have transformed the computer
         industry.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0004_split_016.html#endnote_text_6">6</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_6"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="spb">In Digital’s case, as in Sears, the very decisions that led to its decline were made at the time it was so widely regarded
         as being an astutely managed firm. It was praised as a paragon of managerial excellence at the very time it was ignoring the
         arrival of the desktop computers that besieged it a few years later.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Sears and Digital are in noteworthy company. Xerox long dominated the market for plain paper photocopiers used in large, high-volume
         copying centers. Yet it missed huge growth and profit opportunities in the market for small tabletop photocopiers, where it
         became only a minor player. Although steel minimills have now captured 40 percent of the North American steel market, including
         nearly all of the region’s markets for bars, rods, and structural steel, not a <em class="calibre2">single</em> integrated steel company— American, Asian, or European—had by 1995 built a plant using minimill technology. Of the thirty
         manufacturers of cable-actuated power shovels, 
         <a id="pagexii"></a>only four survived the industry’s twenty-five-year transition to hydraulic excavation technology.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As we shall see, the list of leading companies that failed when confronted with disruptive changes in technology and market
         structure is a long one. At first glance, there seems to be no pattern in the changes that overtook them. In some cases the
         new technologies swept through quickly; in others, the transition took decades. In some, the new technologies were complex
         and expensive to develop. In others, the deadly technologies were simple extensions of what the leading companies already
         did better than anyone else. One theme common to all of these failures, however, is that the decisions that led to failure
         were made when the leaders in question were widely regarded as among the best companies in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">There are two ways to resolve this paradox. One might be to conclude that firms such as Digital, IBM, Apple, Sears, Xerox,
         and Bucyrus Erie must <em class="calibre2">never</em> have been well managed. Maybe they were successful because of good luck and fortuitous timing, rather than good management.
         Maybe they finally fell on hard times because their good fortune ran out. Maybe. An alternative explanation, however, is that
         these failed firms were as well-run as one could expect a firm managed by mortals to be—but that there is something about
         the way decisions get made in successful organizations that sows the seeds of eventual failure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The research reported in this book supports this latter view: It shows that in the cases of well-managed firms such as those
         cited above, <em class="calibre2">good</em> management was the most powerful reason they failed to stay atop their industries. Precisely <em class="calibre2">because</em> these firms listened to their customers, invested aggressively in new technologies that would provide their customers more
         and better products of the sort they wanted, and because they carefully studied market trends and systematically allocated
         investment capital to innovations that promised the best returns, they lost their positions of leadership.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">What this implies at a deeper level is that many of what are now widely accepted principles of good management are, in fact,
         only situationally appropriate. There are times at which it is right <em class="calibre2">not</em> to listen to customers, right to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise <em class="calibre2">lower</em> margins, and right to aggressively pursue small, rather than substantial, markets. This book derives a set of rules, from
         carefully designed research and analysis of innovative successes and failures in the disk drive and other industries, that
         managers can use to judge when the widely 
         <a id="pagexiii"></a>accepted principles of good management should be followed and when alternative principles are appropriate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">These rules, which I call <em class="calibre2">principles of disruptive innovation</em>, show that when good companies fail, it often has been because their managers either ignored these principles or chose to
         fight them. Managers can be extraordinarily effective in managing even the most difficult innovations if they work to understand
         and harness the principles of disruptive innovation. As in many of life’s most challenging endeavors, there is great value
         in coming to grips with “the way the world works,” and in managing innovative efforts in ways that accommodate such forces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre2">The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> is intended to help a wide range of managers, consultants, and academics in manufacturing and service businesses—high tech
         or low—in slowly evolving or rapidly changing environments. Given that aim, <em class="calibre2">technology</em>, as used in this book, means the processes by which an organization transforms labor, capital, materials, and information
         into products and services of greater value. All firms have technologies. A retailer like Sears employs a particular technology
         to procure, present, sell, and deliver products to its customers, while a discount warehouse retailer like PriceCostco employs
         a different technology. This concept of technology therefore extends beyond engineering and manufacturing to encompass a range
         of marketing, investment, and managerial processes. <em class="calibre2">Innovation</em> refers to a change in one of these technologies.
