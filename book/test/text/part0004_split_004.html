      <p class="p">Most new technologies foster improved product performance. I call these <em class="calibre2">sustaining technologies.</em> Some sustaining technologies can be discontinuous or radical in character, while others are of an incremental nature. What
         all sustaining technologies have in common is that they improve the performance of established products, along the dimensions
         of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given
         industry are sustaining in character. An important finding revealed in this book is that rarely have even the most radically
         difficult sustaining technologies precipitated the failure of leading firms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Occasionally, however, <em class="calibre2">disruptive technologies</em> emerge: innovations that result in <em class="calibre2">worse</em> product performance, at least in the near-term. Ironically, in each of the instances studied in this book, it was disruptive
         technology that precipitated the leading firms’ failure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition than had been available previously. Generally,
         disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe
         (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and,
         frequently, more convenient to use. There are many examples in addition to the personal desktop computer and discount retailing
         examples cited above. Small off-road motorcycles introduced in North America and Europe by Honda, Kawasaki, and Yamaha were
         disruptive technologies relative to the powerful, over-the-road cycles made by Harley-Davidson and BMW. Transistors were disruptive
         technologies relative to vacuum tubes. Health maintenance organizations were disruptive technologies to conventional health
         insurers. In the near future, “internet appliances” may become disruptive technologies to suppliers of personal computer hardware
         and software.
