<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_3">THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE</h1>
      <p class="p">My investigation into why leading firms found it so difficult to stay atop the disk drive industry led me to develop the “technology
         mudslide hypothesis”: Coping with the relentless onslaught of technology change was akin to trying to climb a mudslide raging
         down a hill. You have to scramble with everything you’ve got to stay on top of it, and if you ever once stop to catch your
         breath, you get buried.

      <p class="p"><em class="calibre2">Source:</em> Data are from various issues of <em class="calibre2">Disk/Trend Report.</em></p>
      <p class="spb">To test this hypothesis, I assembled and analyzed a database consisting of the technical and performance specifications of
         every model of disk drive introduced by every company in the world disk drive industry for each of the years between 1975
         and 1994.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0006_split_012.html#endnote_text_9">2</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_9"></a> This database enabled me to identify the firms that led in introducing each new technology; to trace how new technologies
         were diffused through the industry over time; to see which firms led and which lagged; and to measure the impact each technological
         innovation had on capacity, speed, and other parameters of disk drive performance. By carefully reconstructing the history
         of each technological change in the industry, the changes that catapulted entrants to success or that precipitated the failure
         of established leaders could be identified.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This study led me to a very different view of technology change than the work of prior scholars on this question had led me
         to expect. Essentially, it revealed that neither the pace nor the difficulty of technological change 
         <a id="page9"></a>lay at the root of the leading firms’ failures. The technology mudslide hypothesis was wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The manufacturers of most products have established a trajectory of performance improvement over time.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0006_split_012.html#endnote_text_10">3</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_10"></a> Intel, for example, pushed the speed of its microprocessors ahead by about 20 percent per year, from its 8 megahertz (MHz)
         8088 processor in 1979 to its 133 MHz Pentium chip in 1994. Eli Lilly and Company improved the purity of its insulin from
         50,000 impure parts per million (ppm) in 1925 to 10 ppm in 1980, a 14 percent annual rate of improvement. When a measurable
         trajectory of improvement has been established, determining whether a new technology is likely to improve a product’s performance
         relative to earlier products is an unambiguous question.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">But in other cases, the impact of technological change is quite different. For instance, is a notebook computer better than
         a mainframe? This is an ambiguous question because the notebook computer established a completely new performance trajectory,
         with a definition of performance that differs substantially from the way mainframe performance is measured. Notebooks, as
         a consequence, are generally sold for very different uses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This study of technological change over the history of the disk drive industry revealed two types of technology change, each
         with very different effects on the industry’s leaders. Technologies of the first sort <em class="calibre2">sustained</em> the industry’s rate of improvement in product performance (total capacity and recording density were the two most common
         measures) and ranged in difficulty from incremental to radical. The industry’s dominant firms always led in developing and
         adopting these technologies. By contrast, innovations of the second sort <em class="calibre2">disrupted</em> or redefined performance trajectories—and consistently resulted in the failure of the industry’s leading firms.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0006_split_012.html#endnote_text_11">4</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_11"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The remainder of this chapter illustrates the distinction between sustaining and disruptive technologies by describing prominent
         examples of each and summarizing the role these played in the industry’s development. This discussion focuses on differences
         in how established firms came to lead or lag in developing and adopting new technologies, compared with entrant firms. To
         arrive at these examples, each new technology in the industry was examined. In analyzing which firms led and lagged at each
         of these points of change, I defined <em class="calibre2">established firms</em> to be those that had been established in the industry prior to the advent of the technology in question, practicing the prior
         technology. I defined <em class="calibre2">entrant firms</em> as those 
         <a id="page10"></a>that were new to the industry at that point of technology change. Hence, a given firm would be considered an entrant at one
         specific point in the industry’s history, for example, at the emergence of the 8-inch drive. Yet the same firm would be considered
         an established firm when technologies that emerged subsequent to the firm’s entry were studied.
