<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_7"><em class="calibre2">Distribution Strategy for Disruptive Innovations</em></h2>
      <p class="p">It has almost always been the case that disruptive products redefine the dominant distribution channels, because dealers’
         economics—their models for how to make money—are powerfully shaped by the mainstream value network, just as the manufacturer’s
         are. Sony’s disruptive introduction of convenient and reliable portable transistorized radios and televisions shifted the
         dominant retail channel from appliance and department stores with expensive sales support and field service networks (required
         for sets built with vacuum tubes) to volume-oriented, low-overhead discount retailers. Honda’s disruptive motorbikes were
         rejected by mainstream motorcycle dealers, forcing the company to create a new channel among sporting goods retailers. We
         saw, in fact, that a major reason why Harley-Davidson’s small-bike initiative failed is that its dealers rejected it: The
         image and economics of the small Italian bikes Harley had acquired did not fit its dealer network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The reason disruptive technologies and new distribution channels frequently go hand-in-hand is, in fact, an economic one.
         Retailers and distributors tend to have very clear formulas for making money, as the histories of Kresge and Woolworth in
         <a href="part0009_split_000.html">chapter 4</a> showed. Some make money by selling low volumes of big-ticket products at high margins; others make 
         <a id="page217"></a>money by selling large volumes at razor-thin margins that cover minimal operating overheads; still others make their money
         servicing products already sold. Just as disruptive technologies don’t fit the models of established firms for improving profits,
         they often don’t fit the models of their <em class="calibre2">distributors</em>, either.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">My electric vehicle program would, therefore, have as a basic strategic premise the need to find or create new distribution
         channels for electric vehicles. Unless proven otherwise, I’d bet that mainstream dealers of gasoline-powered automobiles would
         not view the sorts of disruptive electric vehicles we have in mind as critical to their success.
