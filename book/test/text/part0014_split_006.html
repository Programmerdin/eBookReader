<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_6">THE MIGRATION OF CAPABILITIES</h1>
      <p class="p">In the start-up stages of an organization, much of what gets done is attributable to its <em class="calibre2">resources</em>—its people. The addition or departure of a few key people can have a profound influence on its success. Over time, however,
         the locus of the organization’s capabilities shifts toward its processes and values. As people work together successfully
         to address recurrent tasks, processes become defined. And as the business model takes shape and it becomes clear which types
         of business need to be accorded highest priority, values coalesce. In fact, one reason that many soaring young companies flame
         out after they go public based upon a hot initial product is that whereas their initial success was grounded in resources—
         the founding group of engineers—they fail to create <em class="calibre2">processes</em> that can create a <em class="calibre2">sequence</em> of hot products.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">An example of such flame out is the story of Avid Technology, a producer of digital editing systems for television. Avid’s
         technology removed tedium from the video editing process. Customers loved it, and on the back of its star product, Avid stock
         rose from $16 at its 1993 IPO to $49 in mid-1995. However, the strains of being a one-trick pony soon surfaced as Avid was
         faced with a saturated market, rising inventories and receivables, and increased competition. Customers loved the product,
         but Avid’s lack of effective processes to consistently develop new products and to control quality, delivery, and service
         ultimately tripped the company and sent its stock back down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In contrast, at highly successful firms such as McKinsey and Company, the processes and values have become so powerful that
         it almost doesn’t matter which people get assigned to which project teams. Hundreds of new MBAs join the firm every year,
         and almost as many leave. But the company is able to crank out high-quality work year after year because its core capabilities
         are rooted in its processes and values 
         <a id="page169"></a>rather than in its resources. I sense, however, that these capabilities of McKinsey also constitute its disabilities. The
         rigorously analytical, data-driven processes that help it create value for its clients in existing, relatively stable markets
         render it much less capable of building a strong client base among the rapidly growing companies in dynamic technology markets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In the formative stages of a company’s processes and values, the actions and attitudes of the company’s founder have a profound
         impact. The founder often has strong opinions about the way employees ought to work together to reach decisions and get things
         done. Founders similarly impose their views of what the organization’s priorities need to be. If the founder’s methods are
         flawed, of course, the company will likely fail. But if those methods are useful, employees will collectively experience for
         themselves the validity of the founder’s problem-solving methodologies and criteria for decision-making. As they successfully
         use those methods of working together to address recurrent tasks, processes become defined. Likewise, if the company becomes
         financially successful by prioritizing various uses of its resources according to criteria that reflect the founder’s priorities,
         the company’s values begin to coalesce.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As successful companies mature, employees gradually come to assume that the priorities they have learned to accept, and the
         ways of doing things and methods of making decisions that they have employed so successfully, are the right way to work. Once
         members of the organization begin to adopt ways of working and criteria for making decisions by assumption, rather than by
         conscious decision, then those processes and values come to constitute the organization’s <em class="calibre2">culture</em>.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0014_split_013.html#endnote_text_7">7</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_7"></a> As companies grow from a few employees to hundreds and thousands, the challenge of getting all employees to agree on what
         needs to be done and how it should be done so that the right jobs are done repeatedly and consistently can be daunting for
         even the best managers. Culture is a powerful management tool in these situations. Culture enables employees to act autonomously
         and causes them to act consistently.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Hence, the location of the most powerful factors that define the capabilities and disabilities of organizations migrates over
         time —from resources toward visible, conscious processes and values, and then toward culture. As long as the organization
         continues to face the same sorts of problems that its processes and values were designed to address, managing the organization
         is relatively straightforward. But because these factors also 
         <a id="page170"></a>define what an organization <em class="calibre2">cannot</em> do, they constitute disabilities when the problems facing the company change. When the organization’s capabilities reside
         primarily in its people, changing to address new problems is relatively simple. But when the capabilities have come to reside
         in processes and values and <em class="calibre2">especially</em> when they have become embedded in culture, change can become extraordinarily difficult.
