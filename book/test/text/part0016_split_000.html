         arrogance, tired executive blood, poor planning, and short-term investment horizons obviously have played leading roles in
         toppling many companies. But we have learned here that even the best managers are subject to certain laws that make disruptive
         innovation difficult. It is when great managers havenâ€™t understood or have attempted to fight these forces that their companies
         have stumbled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This chapter uses the forces and principles described in earlier chapters to illustrate how managers can succeed when faced
         with disruptive technology change. To do so, I employ a case study format, using a personal voice, to suggest how I, as a
         hypothetical employee of a major automaker, might manage a program to develop and commercialize one of the most vexing innovations
         of our day: the electric vehicle. My purpose here is explicitly <em class="calibre2">not</em> to offer any so-called right answer to this particular challenge, nor to predict whether or how electric vehicles may become
         commercially successful. Rather, it is to suggest in a familiar but challenging context how managers might structure their
         thinking about a similar problem by proposing a sequence of questions that, if asked, can lead to a sound and useful answer.
