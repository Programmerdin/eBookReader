<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_7">CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYDRAULICS ERUPTION</h1>
      <p class="p">What went wrong within the companies that made cable-actuated excavators? Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, they should
         have invested in hydraulics machines and embedded that piece of their organizations charged with making hydraulic products
         in the value network that needed them. But the dilemma in managing the disruptive technology in the heat of the battle is
         that nothing went wrong inside these companies. Hydraulics was a technology that their customers didn’t need—indeed, couldn’t
         use. Each cable shovel manufacturer was one of at least twenty manufacturers doing everything they could to steal each other’s
         customers: If they took their eyes off their customers’ next-generation needs, existing business would have been put at risk.
         Moreover, developing bigger, better, and faster cable excavators to steal share from existing competitors constituted a much
         more obvious opportunity for profitable growth than did a venture into hydraulic backhoes, given how small the backhoe market
         was when it appeared in the 1950s. So, as we have seen before, these companies did not fail because the technology wasn’t
         available. They did not fail because they lacked information about hydraulics or how to use it; indeed, the best of them used
         it as soon as it could help their customers. They did not fail because management was sleepy or arrogant. They failed because
         hydraulics didn’t make sense—until it was too late.

      <p class="calibre5">The patterns of success and failure we see among firms faced with sustaining and disruptive technology change are a natural
         or systematic result of <em class="calibre2">good</em> managerial decisions. That is, in fact, why disruptive technologies confront innovators with such a dilemma. Working harder,
         being smarter, investing more aggressively, and listening more astutely to customers are all solutions to the problems posed
         by new sustaining technologies. But these paradigms of sound management are useless—even counterproductive, in many instances—when
         dealing with disruptive technology.
