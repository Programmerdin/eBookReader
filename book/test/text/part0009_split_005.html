      <p class="p">The impetus to drift upmarket can be particularly powerful when a firm’s customers themselves are migrating upmarket. In such
         circumstances, suppliers of an intermediate component such as a disk drive may not sense their northeasterly migration because
         they are embedded among competitors and customers experiencing a similar drift.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In this light, we can see how easy it would have been for the leading 8-inch disk drive makers—Priam, Quantum, and Shugart—to
         miss the 5.25-inch generation of drives. Not a single one of their core customers, 
         <a id="page87"></a>for example, Digital Equipment, Prime Computer, Data General, Wang Laboratories, and Nixdorf, successfully introduced a desktop
         computer. Instead, each was moving upmarket <em class="calibre2">itself</em> toward ever higher performance segments of their markets, trying to win the business of customers who historically had used
         mainframes. Similarly, not a single one of the customers of the 14-inch drive makers—mainframe makers such as Univac, Burroughs,
         NCR, ICL, Siemens, and Amdahl—ever made a bold enough move downmarket into minicomputers to become a significant player there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Three factors—the promise of upmarket margins, the simultaneous upmarket movement of many of a company’s customers, and the
         difficulty of cutting costs to move downmarket profitably—together create powerful barriers to downward mobility. In the internal
         debates about resource allocation for new product development, therefore, proposals to pursue disruptive technologies generally
         lose out to proposals to move upmarket. In fact, cultivating a systematic approach to weeding out new product development
         initiatives that would likely lower profits is one of the most important achievements of any well-managed company.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">An important strategic implication of this rational pattern of upmarket movement is that it can create vacuum in low-end value
         networks that draws in entrants with technologies and cost structures better suited to competition. One of these powerful
         downmarket voids occurred in the steel industry, for example, when entrant companies employing disruptive minimill process
         technology entered through low-end beachheads; they have attacked relentlessly upmarket ever since.
