      <p class="p">When managers tackle an innovation problem, they instinctively work to assign capable people to the job. But once they’ve
         found the right people, too many managers then assume that the organization in which they’ll work will also be capable of
         succeeding at the task. And that is dangerous—because organizations have capabilities that exist independently of the people
         who work within them. An organization’s capabilities reside in two places. The first is in its processes—the methods by which
         people have learned to transform inputs of labor, energy, materials, information, cash, and technology into outputs of higher
         value. The second is in the organization’s values, which are the criteria that managers and employees in the organization
         use when making prioritization decisions. People are quite flexible, in that they can be trained to succeed at quite different
         things. An employee of IBM, for example, can quite readily change the way he or she works, in order to work successfully in
         a small start-up company. But processes and values are not flexible. A process that is effective at managing the design of
         a minicomputer, for example, would be ineffective at managing the design of a desktop personal computer. 
         <a id="pagexxiii"></a>Similarly, values that cause employees to prioritize projects to develop high-margin products, cannot simultaneously accord
         priority to low-margin products. The very processes and values that constitute an organization’s capabilities in one context,
         define its <em class="calibre2">dis</em>abilities in another context.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><a href="part0014_split_000.html">Chapter 8</a> will present a framework that can help a manager understand precisely where in his or her organization its capabilities
         and disabilities reside. Drawing on studies in the disk drive and computer industries, it offers tools that managers can use
         to create new capabilities, when the processes and values of the present organization would render it incapable of successfully
         addressing a new problem.
