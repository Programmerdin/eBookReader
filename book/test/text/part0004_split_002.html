      <p class="p">I begin this book by digging deep before extending the discussion to draw general conclusions. The first two chapters recount
         in some detail the history of the disk drive industry, where the saga of “good-companies-hitting-hard-times” has been played
         out over and over again. This industry is an ideal field for studying failure because rich data about it exist and because,
         in the words of Harvard Business School Dean Kim B. Clark, it is “fast history.” In just a few years, market segments, companies,
         and technologies have emerged, matured, and declined. Only twice in the six times that new architectural technologies have
         emerged in this field has the industry’s dominant firm maintained its lead in the subsequent generation. This repetitive pattern
         of failure in the disk drive industry allowed me first to develop a preliminary framework that explained why the best and
         largest firms in the early generations of this industry failed and then to test this framework across subsequent cycles in
         the industry’s history to see whether it was robust enough to continue to explain failures among the industry’s more recent
         leaders.

      <p class="calibre5"><a href="part0008_split_000.html">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="part0009_split_000.html">4</a> then deepen our understanding of why the leading firms stumbled repeatedly in the disk drive industry and,
         simultaneously, test the breadth of the framework’s usefulness by examining the failure of firms in industries with very different
         characteristics. Hence, <a href="part0008_split_000.html">chapter 3</a>, exploring the mechanical excavator industry, finds that the same factors that precipitated
         the failure of the leading disk drive makers also proved to be the undoing of the leading makers of mechanical excavators,
         in an industry that moves with a very different pace and technological intensity. <a href="part0009_split_000.html">Chapter 4</a> completes the framework and uses
         it to show why integrated steel companies worldwide have proven so incapable of blunting the attacks of the minimill steel
         makers.
