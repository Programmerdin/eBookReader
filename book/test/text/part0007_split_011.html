      <p class="p">In response to the needs of current customers, the marketing managers threw impetus behind alternative sustaining projects,
         such as incorporating 
         <a id="page45"></a>better heads or developing new recording codes. These gave customers what they wanted and could be targeted at large markets
         to generate the necessary sales and profits for maintaining growth. Although often involving greater development expense,
         such sustaining investments appeared <em class="calibre2">far</em> less risky than investments in the disruptive technology: The customers existed, and their needs were known.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Seagate’s decision to shelve the 3.5-inch drive in 1985 to 1986, for example, seems starkly rational. Its view downmarket
         (in terms of the disk drive trajectory map) was toward a small total market forecast for 1987 for 3.5-inch drives. Gross margins
         in that market were uncertain, but manufacturing executives predicted that costs per megabyte for 3.5-inch drives would be
         much higher than for 5.25-inch drives. Seagate’s view upmarket was quite different. Volumes in 5.25-inch drives with capacities
         of 60 to 100 MB were forecast to be $500 million by 1987. Companies serving the 60 to 100 MB market were earning gross margins
         of between 35 and 40 percent, whereas Seagate’s margins in its high-volume 20 MB drives were between 25 and 30 percent. It
         simply did not make sense for Seagate to put its resources behind the 3.5-inch drive when competing proposals to move upmarket
         by developing its ST251 line of drives were also being actively evaluated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">After Seagate executives shelved the 3.5-inch project, the firm began introducing new 5.25-inch models at a dramatically accelerated
         rate. In 1985, 1986, and 1987, the numbers of new models annually introduced as a percentage of the total number of its models
         on the market in the prior year were 57, 78, and 115 percent, respectively. And during the same period, Seagate incorporated
         complex and sophisticated new component technologies such as thin-film disks, voice-coil actuators,

         <a id="endnote_reference_40"></a> RLL codes, and embedded SCSI interfaces. Clearly, the motivation in doing this was to win the competitive wars against other
         established firms, which were making similar improvements, rather than to prepare for an attack by entrants from below.
