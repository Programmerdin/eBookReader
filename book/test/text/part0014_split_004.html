<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_4"><em class="calibre2">Values</em></h2>
      <p class="p">The third class of factors that affect what an organization can or cannot accomplish is its values. The values of an organization
         are the criteria by which decisions about priorities are made. Some corporate values are ethical in tone, such as those that
         guide decisions to ensure patient well-being at Johnson &amp; Johnson or that guide decisions about plant safety at Alcoa. But
         within the Resources-Processes-Values (RPV) framework, values have a broader meaning. An organization’s values are the standards
         by which employees make prioritization decisions—by which they judge whether an order is attractive or unattractive; whether
         a customer is more important or less important; whether an idea for a new product is attractive or marginal; and so on. Prioritization
         decisions are made by employees at every level. At the executive tiers, they often take the form of decisions to invest or
         not invest in new products, services, and processes. Among salespeople, they consist of on-the-spot, day-to-day decisions
         about which products to push with customers and which not to emphasize.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The larger and more complex a company becomes, the more important it is for senior managers to train employees at every level
         to make independent decisions about priorities that are consistent with the strategic direction and the business model of
         the company. A key metric of good management, in fact, is whether such clear and consistent values have permeated the organization.

         <a id="endnote_reference_6"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page165"></a>Clear, consistent, and broadly understood values, however, also define what an organization cannot do. A company’s values,
         by necessity, must reflect its cost structure or its business model, because these define the rules its employees must follow
         in order for the company to make money. If, for example, the structure of a company’s overhead costs requires it to achieve
         gross profit margins of 40 percent, a powerful value or decision rule will have evolved that encourages middle managers to
         kill ideas that promise gross margins below 40 percent. This means that such an organization would be <em class="calibre2">incapable</em> of successfully commercializing projects targeting low-margin markets. At the same time, another organization’s values, driven
         by a very different cost structure, might enable or facilitate the success of the very same project.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The values of successful firms tend to evolve in a predictable fashion in at least two dimensions. The first relates to acceptable
         gross margins. As companies add features and functionality to their products and services in order to capture more attractive
         customers in premium tiers of their markets, they often add overhead cost. As a result, gross margins that at one point were
         quite attractive, at a later point seem unattractive. Their values change. For example, Toyota entered the North American
         market with its Corona model—a product targeting the lowest-priced tiers of the market. As the entry tier of the market became
         crowded with look-alike models from Nissan, Honda, and Mazda, competition among equally low-cost competitors drove down profit
         margins. Toyota developed more sophisticated cars targeted at higher tiers of the market in order to improve its margins.
         Its Corolla, Camry, Previa, Avalon, and Lexus families of cars have been introduced in response to the same competitive pressures—it
         kept its margins healthy by migrating up-market. In the process, Toyota has had to add costs to its operation to design, build,
         and support cars of this caliber. It progressively deemphasized the entry-level tiers of the market, having found the margins
         it could earn there to be unattractive, given its changed cost structure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Nucor Steel, the leading minimill that led the up-market charge against the integrated mills that was recounted in chapter
         4, likewise has experienced a change in values. As it has managed the center of gravity in its product line up-market from
         re-bar to angle iron to structural beams and finally to sheet steel, it has begun to decidedly deemphasize re-bar—the product
         that had been its bread and butter in its earlier years.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The second dimension along which values predictably change relates to how big a business has to be in order to be interesting.
         Because a 
         <a id="page166"></a>company’s stock price represents the discounted present value of its projected earnings stream, most managers typically feel
         compelled not just to maintain growth, but to maintain a constant <em class="calibre2">rate</em> of growth. In order for a $40 million company to grow 25 percent, it needs to find $10 million in new business the next year.
         For a $40 <em class="calibre2">billion</em> company to grow 25 percent, it needs to find $10 billion in new business the next year. The size of market opportunity that
         will solve each of these companies’ needs for growth is very different. As noted in <a href="part0012_split_000.html">chapter 6</a>, an opportunity that excites
         a small organization isn’t big enough to be interesting to a very large one. One of the bittersweet rewards of success is,
         in fact, that as companies become large, they literally lose the capability to enter small emerging markets. This disability
         is not because of a change in the resources within the companies—their resources typically are vast. Rather, it is because
         their values change.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Executives and Wall Street financiers who engineer megamergers among already huge companies in order to achieve cost savings
         need to account for the impact of these actions on the resultant companies’ values. Although their merged organizations might
         have more resources to throw at innovation problems, their commercial organizations tend to lose their appetites for all but
         the biggest blockbuster opportunities. Huge size constitutes a very real <em class="calibre2">disability</em> in managing innovation. In many ways, Hewlett-Packard’s recent decision to split itself into two companies is rooted in its
         recognition of this problem.
