      <p class="p">Excavators are one of many types of earthmoving equipment. Some equipment, such as bulldozers, loaders, graders, and scrapers,
         essentially push, smooth, and lift earth. Excavators

         <a id="endnote_reference_55"></a> have been used to dig holes and trenches, primarily in three markets: first and largest, the general excavation market, composed
         of contractors who dig holes for basements or civil engineering projects such as canal construction; second, sewer and piping
         contractors, who generally dig long trenches; and third, open pit or strip mining. In each of these markets, contractors have
         tended to measure the functionality of mechanical excavators by their reach or extension distance and by the cubic yards of
         earth lifted in a single scoop.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In 1945, sewer and piping contractors used machines whose bucket 
         <a id="page65"></a>capacity averaged about 1 cubic yard (best for digging relatively narrow trenches), while the average general excavation contractor
         used excavators that hefted 2<sup class="calibre6">1</sup><sub class="calibre16">2</sub> cubic yards per scoop and mining contractors used shovels holding about 5 cubic yards. The average bucket capacity used in
         each of these markets increased at about 4 percent per year, a rate of increase constrained by other factors in the broader
         system-of-use. The logistical problems of transporting large machines into and out of typical construction sites, for example,
         helped limit the rate of increase demanded by contractors.
