<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_6"><em class="calibre2">Failed Ideas versus Failed Businesses</em></h2>
      <p class="p">The case studies reviewed in this chapter suggest a resolution to this puzzle. There is a big difference between the failure
         of an <em class="calibre2">idea</em> and the failure of a <em class="calibre2">firm.</em> Many of the ideas prevailing at Intel about where the disruptive microprocessor could be used were wrong; fortunately, Intel
         had not expended all of its resources implementing wrong-headed marketing plans while the right market direction was still
         unknowable. As a company, Intel survived many false starts in its search for the major market for microprocessors. Similarly,
         Honda’s idea about how to enter the North American motorcycle market was wrong, but the company didn’t deplete its resources
         pursuing its big-bike strategy and was able to invest aggressively in the winning strategy after it had emerged. Hewlett-Packard’s
         Kittyhawk team was not as fortunate. Believing they had identified the winning strategy, its managers spent their budget on
         a product design and the manufacturing capacity for a market application that never emerged. When the ultimate applications
         for the tiny drive ultimately began to coalesce, the Kittyhawk team had no resources left to pursue them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Research has shown, in fact, that the vast majority of successful new business ventures abandoned their original business
         strategies when they began implementing their initial plans and learned what would and would not work in the market.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0013_split_009.html#endnote_text_9">9</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_9"></a> The dominant difference between successful ventures and failed ones, generally, is not the astuteness of their original strategy.
         Guessing the right strategy at the outset isn’t nearly as important to success as conserving enough resources (or having the
         relationships with trusting backers or investors) so that new business initiatives get a second or third stab at getting it
         right. Those that run out of resources or credibility before they can iterate toward a viable strategy are the ones that fail.
