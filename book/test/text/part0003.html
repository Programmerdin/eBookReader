      <p class="p">
         <a id="pagevii"></a>Although this book lists only one author, in reality the ideas it molds together were contributed and refined by many extraordinarily
         insightful and selfless colleagues. The work began when Professors Kim Clark, Joseph Bower, Jay Light, and John McArthur took
         the risk of admitting and financing a middle-aged man’s way into and through the Harvard Business School’s doctoral program
         in 1989. In addition to these mentors, Professors Richard Rosenbloom, Howard Stevenson, Dorothy Leonard, Richard Walton, Bob
         Hayes, Steve Wheelwright, and Kent Bowen helped throughout my doctoral research to keep my thinking sharp and my standards
         for evidence high, and to embed what I was learning within the streams of strong scholarship that had preceded what I was
         attempting to research. None of these professors needed to spend so much of their busy lives guiding me as they did, and I
         will be forever grateful for what they taught me about the substance and process of scholarship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">I am similarly indebted to the many executives and employees of companies in the disk drive industry who opened their memories
         and records to me as I tried to understand what had driven them in the particular courses they had taken. In particular, James
         Porter, editor of <em class="calibre2">Disk/Trend Report</em>, opened his extraordinary archives of data, enabling me to measure what has happened in the disk drive industry with a level
         of completeness and accuracy that could be done in few other settings. The model of the industry’s evolution and revolution
         that these men and women helped me construct has formed the theoretical backbone for this book. I hope they 
         <a id="pageviii"></a>find it to be a useful tool for making sense of their past, and a helpful guide for some of their decisions in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">During my tenure on the Harvard Business School faculty, other colleagues have helped refine this book’s ideas even more.
         Professors Rebecca Henderson and James Utterback of MIT, Robert Burgelman of Stanford, and David Garvin, Gary Pisano, and
         Marco Iansiti of the Harvard Business School have been particularly helpful. Research associates Rebecca Voorheis, Greg Rogers,
         Bret Baird, Jeremy Dann, Tara Donovan, and Michael Overdorf; editors Marjorie Williams, Steve Prokesch, and Barbara Feinberg;
         and assistants Cheryl Druckenmiller, Meredith Anderson, and Marguerite Dole, have likewise contributed untold amounts of data,
         advice, insight, and work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">I am grateful to my students, with whom I have discussed and refined the ideas put forward in this book. On most days I leave
         class wondering why I get paid and why my students pay tuition, given that it is I who have learned the most from our interactions.
         Every year they leave our school with their degrees and scatter around the world, without understanding how much they have
         taught their teachers. I love them and hope that those who come across this book will be able to recognize in it the fruits
         of their puzzled looks, questions, comments, and criticisms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">My deepest gratitude is to my family—my wife Christine and our children Matthew, Ann, Michael, Spencer, and Catherine. With
         unhesitating faith and support they encouraged me to pursue my lifelong dream to be a teacher, amidst all of the demands of
         family life. Doing this research on disruptive technologies has indeed been disruptive to them in terms of time and absence
         from home, and I am forever grateful for their love and support. Christine, in particular, is the smartest and most patient
         person I have known. Most of the ideas in this book went home on some night over the past five years in half-baked condition
         and returned to Harvard the next morning having been clarified, shaped, and edited through my conversations with her. She
         is a great colleague, supporter, and friend. I dedicate this book to her and our children.
