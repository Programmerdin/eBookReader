         <a id="page29"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> From the earliest studies of the problems of innovation, scholars, consultants, and managers have tried to explain why leading
         firms frequently stumble when confronting technology change. Most explanations either zero in on managerial, organizational,
         and cultural responses to technological change or focus on the ability of established firms to deal with radically new technology;
         doing the latter requires a very different set of skills from those that an established firm historically has developed. Both
         approaches, useful in explaining why some companies stumble in the face of technological change, are summarized below. The
         primary purpose of this chapter, however, is to propose a third theory of why good companies can fail, based upon the concept
         of a <em class="calibre2">value network.</em> The value network concept seems to have much greater power than the other two theories in explaining what we observed in
         the disk drive industry.
