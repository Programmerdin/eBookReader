<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_4">THE CASE OF THE 1.8-INCH DISK DRIVE</h1>
      <p class="p">Managers in disk drive companies were very generous in helping me conduct the research reported in this book, and, as the
         results began 
         <a id="page85"></a>emerging in 1992, I began feeding back the published papers that summarized what I was learning. I was particularly interested
         in whether the framework summarized in Figure 1.7 would have an impact on their decisions regarding the 1.8-inch drive, which
         was just then emerging as the industry’s most recent disruptive technology. For industry outsiders, of course, the conclusion
         was obvious: “How many times does this have to happen before these guys learn?! Of course they’ve got to do it.” The guys
         did, in fact, learn. By the end of 1993, each of the leading drive makers had developed 1.8-inch models and had them ready
         for introduction if and when the market developed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In August 1994, I was visiting the CEO of one of the largest disk drive companies and asked him what his firm was doing about
         the 1.8-inch drive. This clearly touched a hot button. He pointed to a shelf in his office where a sample 1.8-inch drive was
         perched. “You see that?” he demanded. “That’s the <em class="calibre2">fourth generation</em> of 1.8-inch drives we’ve developed—each one with more capacity than the last. But we haven’t sold any. We want to be ready
         when the market is there, but there just isn’t a market for them yet.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">I countered by reminding him that <em class="calibre2">Disk/Trend Report</em>, a highly regarded market research publication that was the source of much of the data used in my study, had measured the
         1993 market at $40 million, was projecting 1994 sales to be $80 million, and forecast 1995 volume at $140 million.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">“I know that’s what they think,” he responded. “But they’re wrong. There isn’t a market. We’ve had that drive in our catalog
         for 18 months. Everyone knows we’ve got it, but nobody wants it. The market just isn’t there. We just got way ahead of the
         market.” I had no other basis for pressing my point with this manager, who is one of the most astute managers I’ve ever met.
         Our conversation moved to other issues.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">About a month later I was leading a case discussion in the Harvard MBA program’s technology and operations management course
         about the development of a new engine at Honda. One of the students in the class had previously worked in Honda’s research
         and development organization, so I asked him to take a few minutes to tell the class what it was like working there. It turned
         out that he had been working on dashboard mapping and navigation systems. I couldn’t resist interrupting his talk by asking,
         “How do you store all that data for the maps?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Said the student: “We found a little 1.8-inch disk drive and put it in there. It’s really neat—almost a solid-state device,
         with very few moving parts. Really rugged.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">“Who do you buy them from?” I pressed.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page86"></a>“It’s kind of funny,” he replied. “You can’t buy them from any of the big disk drive companies. We get them from a little
         startup company somewhere in Colorado—I can’t remember the name.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">I have since reflected on why the head of this company would insist so stubbornly that there was no market for 1.8-inch drives,
         even while there was, and why my student would say the big drive makers didn’t sell these drives, even though they were trying.
         The answer lies in the northeast-southeast problem, and in the role that the hundreds of well-trained decision makers in a
         good company play in funneling resources and energy into those projects they perceive will bring the company the greatest
         growth and profit. The CEO had decided that the company was going to catch this next disruptive wave early and had shepherded
         the project through to a successful, economical design. But among the employees, there was nothing about an $80 million, low-end
         market that solved the growth and profit problems of a multibillion dollar company—especially when capable competitors were
         doing all they could to steal away the customers providing those billions. (The revenue figure is disguised.) And way at the
         other end of the company, there was nothing about supplying prototype quantities of 1.8-inch drives to an automaker that solved
         the problem of meeting the 1994 quotas of salespeople whose contacts and expertise were based so solidly in the computer industry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">For an organization to accomplish a task as complex as launching a new product, logic, energy, and impetus must all coalesce
         behind the effort. Hence, it is not just the <em class="calibre2">customers</em> of an established firm that hold it captive to their needs. Established firms are also captive to the financial structure
         and organizational culture inherent in the value network in which they compete—a captivity that can block any rationale for
         timely investment in the next wave of disruptive technology.
