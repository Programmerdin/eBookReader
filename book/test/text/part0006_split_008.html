      <p class="p">The 3.5-inch drive was first developed in 1984 by Rodime, a Scottish entrant. Sales of this architecture were not significant,
         however, until Conner Peripherals, a spinoff of 5.25-inch drive makers Seagate and Miniscribe, started shipping product in
         1987. Conner had developed a small, lightweight drive architecture that was much more rugged than its 5.25-inch ancestors.
         It handled electronically functions that had previously been managed with mechanical parts, and it used microcode to replace
         functions that had previously been addressed electronically. Nearly all of Conner’s first year revenues of $113 million
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0006_split_012.html#endnote_text_21">14</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_21"></a> came from Compaq Computer, which had aided Conner’s start-up with a $30 million investment. The Conner drives were used primarily
         in a new application—portable and laptop machines, in addition to “small footprint” desktop models—where customers were willing
         to accept lower capacities and higher costs per megabyte to get lighter weight, greater ruggedness, and lower power consumption.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Seagate engineers were not oblivious to the coming of the 3.5-inch architecture. Indeed, in early 1985, less than one year
         after Rodime introduced the first 3.5-inch drive and two years <em class="calibre2">before</em> Conner Peripherals started shipping its product, Seagate personnel showed working 3.5-inch prototype drives to customers
         for evaluation. The initiative for the new drives came from Seagate’s engineering organization. Opposition to the program
         came primarily from the marketing organization and Seagate’s executive team; they argued that the market wanted higher capacity
         drives at a lower cost per megabyte and that 3.5-inch drives could never be built at a lower cost per megabyte than 5.25-inch
         drives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Seagate’s marketers tested the 3.5-inch prototypes with customers in the desktop computing market it already served—manufacturers
         like IBM, and value-added resellers of full-sized desktop computer systems. Not surprisingly, they indicated little interest
         in the smaller drive. They were looking for capacities of 40 and 60 megabytes for their next-generation machines, while the
         3.5-inch architecture could provide only 20 MB—and at higher costs.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0006_split_012.html#endnote_text_22">15</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_22"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page21"></a>In response to lukewarm reviews from customers, Seagate’s program manager lowered his 3.5-inch sales estimates, and the firm’s
         executives canceled the program. Their reasoning? The markets for 5.25-inch products were larger, and the sales generated
         by spending the engineering effort on new 5.25-inch products would create greater revenues for the company than would efforts
         targeted at new 3.5-inch products.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In retrospect, it appears that Seagate executives read the market—at least their own market—very accurately. With established
         applications and product architectures of their own, such as the IBM XT and AT, these customers saw no value in the improved
         ruggedness or the reduced size, weight, and power consumption of 3.5-inch products.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Seagate finally began shipping 3.5-inch drives in early 1988—the same year in which the performance trajectory of 3.5-inch
         drives (shown in Figure 1.7) intersected the trajectory of capacity demanded in desktop computers. By that time, the industry
         had shipped, cumulatively, nearly $750 million in 3.5-inch products. Interestingly, according to industry observers, as of
         1991 almost none of Seagate’s 3.5-inch products had been sold to manufacturers of portable/laptop/notebook computers. In other
         words, Seagate’s primary customers were still desktop computer manufacturers, and many of its 3.5-inch drives were shipped
         with frames for mounting them in computers designed for 5.25-inch drives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The fear of cannibalizing sales of existing products is often cited as a reason why established firms delay the introduction
         of new technologies. As the Seagate-Conner experience illustrates, however, if new technologies enable new market applications
         to emerge, the introduction of new technology may not be inherently cannibalistic. But when established firms wait until a
         new technology has become commercially mature in its new applications and launch their own version of the technology only
         in response to an attack on their home markets, the fear of cannibalization can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Although we have been looking at Seagate’s response to the development of the 3.5-inch drive architecture, its behavior was
         not atypical; by 1988, only 35 percent of the drive manufacturers that had established themselves making 5.25-inch products
         for the desktop PC market had introduced 3.5-inch drives. Similar to earlier product architecture transitions, the barrier
         to development of a competitive 3.5-inch product does not appear to have been engineering-based. As in the 14-to 8-inch transition,
         the new-architecture drives introduced by the incumbent, established firms during the transitions from 8 to 5.25 inches and
         from 5.25 to 3.5 inches were fully performance-competitive with those of entrant drives. Rather, 
         <a id="page22"></a>the 5.25-inch drive manufacturers seem to have been misled by their customers, notably IBM and its direct competitors and
         resellers, who themselves seemed as oblivious as Seagate to the potential benefits and possibilities of portable computing
         and the new disk drive architecture that might facilitate it.
