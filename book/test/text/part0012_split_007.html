<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_7">CASE STUDY: GIVING SMALL OPPORTUNITIES TO SMALL ORGANIZATIONS</h1>
 <p class="p">Every innovation is difficult. That difficulty is compounded immeasurably, however, when a project is embedded in an organization
  in which most people are continually questioning why the project is being done at all. Projects make sense to people if they
  address the needs of important customers, if they positively impact the organization’s needs for profit and growth, and if
   participating in the project enhances the career opportunities of talented employees. When a project doesn’t have these characteristics,
   its manager spends much time and energy justifying why it merits resources and cannot manage the project as effectively. Frequently
   in such circumstances, the best people do not want to be associated with the project—and when things get tight, projects viewed
   as nonessential are the first to be canceled or postponed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">Executives can give an enormous boost to a project’s probability of success, therefore, when they ensure that it is being
   executed in an environment in which everyone involved views the endeavor as crucial to the organization’s future growth and
   profitability. Under these conditions, when the inevitable disappointments, unforeseen problems, and schedule slippages occur,
   the organization will be more likely to find ways to muster whatever is required to solve the problem.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">As we have seen, a project to commercialize a disruptive technology in a small, emerging market is very unlikely to be considered
   essential to success in a large company; small markets don’t solve the growth problems of big companies. Rather than continually
   working to convince and remind everyone that the small, disruptive technology might <em class="calibre2">someday</em> be significant 
   <a id="page135"></a>or that it is at least strategically important, large companies should seek to embed the project in an organization that is
   small enough to be motivated by the opportunity offered by a disruptive technology in its early years. This can be done either
   by spinning out an independent organization or by acquiring an appropriately small company. Expecting achievement-driven employees
   in a large organization to devote a critical mass of resources, attention, and energy to a disruptive project targeted at
   a small and poorly defined market is equivalent to flapping one’s arms in an effort to fly: It denies an important tendency
   in the way organizations work.

  <p class="calibre5">There are many success stories to the credit of this approach. Control Data, for example, which had essentially missed the
   8-inch disk drive generation, sent a group to Oklahoma City to commercialize its 5.25-inch drive. In addition to CDC’s need
   to escape the power of its mainstream customers, the firm explicitly wanted to create an organization whose size matched the
   opportunity. “We needed an organization,” reflected one manager, “that could get excited about a $50,000 order. In Minneapolis
   [which derived nearly $1 billion from the sale of 14-inch drives in the mainframe market] you needed a million-dollar order
   just to turn anyone’s head.” CDC’s Oklahoma City venture proved to be a significant success.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">Another way of matching the size of an organization to the size of the opportunity is to acquire a small company within which
   to incubate the disruptive technology. This is how Allen Bradley negotiated its very successful disruptive transition from
   mechanical to electronic motor controls.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">For decades the Allen Bradley Company (AB) in Milwaukee has been the undisputed leader in the motor controls industry, making
   heavy-duty, sophisticated switches that turn large electric motors off and on and protect them from overloads and surges in
   current. AB’s customers were makers of machine tools and cranes as well as contractors who installed fans and pumps for industrial
   and commercial heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Motor controls were electromechanical devices that
   operated on the same principle as residential light switches, although on a larger scale. In sophisticated machine tools and
   HVAC systems, electric motors and their controls were often linked, through systems of electromechanical relay switches, to
   turn on and off in particular sequences and under particular conditions. Because of the value of the equipment they controlled
   and the high cost of equipment downtime, 
   <a id="page136"></a>controls were required to be rugged, capable of turning on and off millions of times and of withstanding the vibrations and
   dirt that characterized the environments in which they were used.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">In 1968, a startup company, Modicon, began selling electronic programmable motor controls—a disruptive technology from the
   point of view of mainstream users of electromechanical controls. Texas Instruments (TI) entered the fray shortly thereafter
   with its own electronic controller. Because early electronic controllers lacked the real and perceived ruggedness and robustness
   for harsh environments of the hefty AB-type controllers, Modicon and TI were unable to sell their products to mainstream machine
   tool makers and HVAC contractors. As performance was measured in the mainstream markets, electronic products underperformed
   conventional controllers, and few mainstream customers needed the programmable flexibility offered by electronic controllers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">As a consequence, Modicon and TI were forced to cultivate an emerging market for programmable controllers: the market for
   factory automation. Customers in this emerging market were not equipment manufacturers, but equipment <em class="calibre2">users</em>, such as Ford and General Motors, who were just beginning their attempt to integrate pieces of automatic manufacturing equipment.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">Of the five leading manufacturers of electromechanical motor controls—Allen Bradley, Square D, Cutler Hammer, General Electric,
   and Westinghouse—only Allen Bradley retained a strong market position as programmable electronic controls improved in ruggedness
   and began to invade the core motor control markets. Allen Bradley entered the electronic controller market just two years
   after Modicon and built a market-leading position in the new technology within a few years, even as it kept its strength in
   its old electromechanical products. It subsequently transformed itself into a major supplier of electronic controllers for
   factory automation. The other four companies, by contrast, introduced electronic controllers much later and subsequently either
   exited the controller business or were reduced to weak positions. From a capabilities perspective this is a surprising outcome,
   because General Electric and Westinghouse had much deeper expertise in microelectronics technologies at that time than did
   Allen Bradley, which had no institutional experience in the technology.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">What did Allen Bradley do differently? In 1969, just one year after Modicon entered the market, AB executives bought a 25
   percent interest 
   <a id="page137"></a>in Information Instruments, Inc., a fledgling programmable controller start-up based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The following
   year it purchased outright a nascent division of Bunker Ramo, which was focused on programmable electronic controls and their
   emerging markets. AB combined these acquisitions into a single unit and maintained it as a business separate from its mainstream
   electromechanical products operation in Milwaukee. Over time, the electronics products have significantly eaten into the electromechanical
   controller business, as one AB division attacked the other.
   <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_18">18</a></sup>
   <a id="endnote_reference_18"></a> By contrast, each of the other four companies tried to manage its electronic controller businesses from within its mainstream
   electromechanical divisions, whose customers did not initially need or want electronic controls. Each failed to develop a
   viable position in the new technology.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">Johnson &amp; Johnson has with great success followed a strategy similar to Allen Bradley’s in dealing with disruptive technologies
   such as endoscopic surgical equipment and disposable contact lenses. Though its total revenues amount to more than $20 billion,
   J&amp;J comprises 160 autonomously operating companies, which range from its huge MacNeil and Janssen pharmaceuticals companies
   to small companies with annual revenues of less than $20 million. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s strategy is to launch products of disruptive
   technologies through very small companies acquired for that purpose.
