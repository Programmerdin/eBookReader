      <p class="p">Micropolis Corporation, an early disk drive leader founded in 1978 to make 8-inch drives, was the only other industry player
         to successfully make the transition to a disruptive platform. It did not use the spin-out strategy that had worked for Quantum
         and Control Data, however, choosing instead to manage the change from within the mainstream company. But even this exception
         supports the rule that customers exert exceptionally powerful influence over the investments that firms can undertake successfully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Micropolis began to change in 1982, when founder and CEO Stuart Mabon intuitively perceived the trajectories of market demand
         and technology supply mapped in Figure 1.7 and decided that the firm should become primarily a maker of 5.25-inch drives.
         While initially hoping to keep adequate resources focused on developing its next generation of 8-inch drives so that Micropolis
         could straddle both markets,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_6">6</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_6"></a> he assigned the company’s premier engineers to the 5.25-inch program. Mabon recalls that it took “100 percent of my time
         and energy for eighteen months” to keep adequate resources focused on the 5.25-inch program, because the organization’s own
         mechanisms allocated resources to where the customers were—8-inch drives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">By 1984, Micropolis had failed to keep pace with competition in the minicomputer market for disk drives and withdrew its remaining
         8-inch models. With Herculean effort, however, it did succeed in its 5.25-inch programs. Figure 5.1 shows why this struggle
         occurred: In making the transition, Micropolis assumed a position on a very different technological trajectory. It had to
         walk away from every one of its major customers and replace the lost revenues with sales of the new product line to an entirely
         different group of desktop computer makers. Mabon remembers the experience as the most exhausting of his life.

      <p class="spb">Micropolis finally introduced a 3.5-inch product in 1993. That was the point at which the product had progressed to pack more
         than 1 gigabyte in the 3.5-inch platform. At that level, Micropolis could sell the 3.5-inch drive to its existing customers.
