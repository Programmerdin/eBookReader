      <p class="p">After identifying the electric vehicle as a potentially disruptive technology; setting realistic bearings for finding its
         potential markets; and establishing strategic parameters for the productâ€™s design, technology, and distribution network, as
         program manager I would next turn to organization. Creating an organizational context in which this effort can prosper will
         be crucial, because rational resource allocation processes in established companies consistently deny disruptive technologies
         the resources they need to survive, regardless of the commitment senior management may ostensibly have made to the program.
