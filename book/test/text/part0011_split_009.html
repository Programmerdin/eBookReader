<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_9">SURVIVAL BY SUICIDE: HEWLETT-PACKARD’S LASER JET AND INK-JET PRINTERS</h1>
      <p class="p">Hewlett-Packard’s experience in the personal computer printer business illustrates how a company’s pursuit of a disruptive
         technology by spinning out an independent organization might entail, in the end, killing another of its business units.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Hewlett-Packard’s storied success in manufacturing printers for personal computers becomes even more remarkable when one considers
         its management of the emergence of bubble-jet or ink-jet technology. Beginning in the mid-1980s, HP began building a huge
         and successful business around laser jet printing technology. The laser jet was a discontinuous 
         <a id="page116"></a>improvement over dot-matrix printing, the previously dominant personal computer printing technology, and HP built a commanding
         market lead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">When an alternative way of translating digital signals into images on paper (ink-jet technology) first appeared, there were
         vigorous debates about whether laser jet or ink jet would emerge as the dominant design in personal printing. Experts lined
         up on both sides of the question, offering HP extensive advice on which technology would ultimately become the printer of
         choice on the world’s desktops.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_15">15</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_15"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Although it was never framed as such in the debates of the time, inkjet printing was a disruptive technology. It was slower
         than the laser jet, its resolution was worse, and its cost per printed page was higher. But the printer itself was smaller
         and potentially much less expensive than the laser jet. At these lower prices, it promised lower gross margin dollars per
         unit than the laser jet. Thus, the ink-jet printer was a classic disruptive product, relative to the laser jet business.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Rather than place its bet exclusively with one or the other, and rather than attempt to commercialize the disruptive ink-jet
         from within the existing printer division in Boise, Idaho, HP created a completely autonomous organizational unit, located
         in Vancouver, Washington, with responsibility for making the ink-jet printer a success. It then let the two businesses compete
         against each other. Each has behaved classically. As shown in Figure 5.4, the laser jet division has moved sharply upmarket,
         in a strategy reminiscent of 14-inch drives, mainframe computers, and integrated steel mills. HP’s laser jet printers can
         print at high speeds with exceptional resolution; handle hundreds of fonts and complicated graphics; print on two sides of
         the page; and serve multiple users on a network. They have also gotten larger physically.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The ink-jet printer isn’t as good as the laser jet and may never be. But the critical question is whether the ink jet could
         ever be as good a printer as the personal desktop computing <em class="calibre2">market</em> demands. The answer appears to be yes. The resolution and speed of ink-jet printers, while still inferior to those of laser
         jets, are now clearly good enough for many students, professionals, and other un-networked users of desktop computers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">HP’s ink-jet printer business is now capturing many of those who would formerly have been laser jet users. Ultimately, the
         number of users at the highest-performance end of the market, toward which the laser jet division is headed, will probably
         become small. One of HP’s businesses may, in the end, have killed another. But had HP not set up its ink-jet business as a
         separate organization, the ink-jet technology would probably have languished within the mainstream laser jet business, leaving
         one of the other companies now actively competing in the ink-jet printer business, such as Canon, as a serious threat to HP’s
         printer business. And by staying in the laser business, as well, HP has joined IBM’s mainframe business and the integrated
         steel companies in making a <em class="calibre2">lot</em> of money while executing an upmarket retreat.
