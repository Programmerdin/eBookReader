      <p class="p">What might emerge as the initial value network for electric vehicles? Again, though it is impossible to predict, it almost
         surely will be one in which the weaknesses of the electric vehicle will be seen as strengths. One of my students has suggested
         that the parents of high school students, who buy their children cars for basic transportation to and from school, friends’
         homes, and school events, might constitute a fertile market for electric vehicles.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_10">10</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_10"></a> Given the option, these parents might see the product simplicity, slow acceleration, and limited driving range of electric
         vehicles as very <em class="calibre2">desirable</em> attributes for their teenagers’ cars—especially if they were styled with teenagers in mind. Given the right marketing approach,
         who knows what might happen? An earlier generation met a lot of nice people on their Hondas.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Another possible early market might be taxis or small-parcel delivery vehicles destined for the growing, crowded, noisy, polluted
         cities of Southeast Asia. Vehicles can sit on Bangkok’s roads all day, mostly idling in traffic jams and never accelerating
         above 30 miles per hour. Electric motors would not need to run and hence would not drain the battery while idling. The maneuverability
         and ease of parking of these small vehicles would be additional attractions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">These or similar market ideas, whether or not they ultimately prove viable, are at least consistent with the way disruptive
         technologies develop and emerge.
