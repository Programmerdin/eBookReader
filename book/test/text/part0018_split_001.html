      <p class="p">In <em class="calibre2">The Innovator’s Dilemma</em>, Professor Clayton Christensen asks the question: Why do well-managed companies fail? He concludes that they often fail because
         the very management practices that have allowed them to become industry leaders also make it extremely difficult for them
         to develop the disruptive technologies that ultimately steal away their markets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Well-managed companies are excellent at developing the sustaining technologies that improve the performance of their products
         in the ways that matter to their customers. This is because their management practices are biased toward:
      </p>
      <div class="calibre26">
      <p class="calibre27">Listening to customers</p>
      <p class="calibre27">Investing aggressively in technologies that give those customers what they say they want</p>
      <p class="calibre27">
         <a id="page232"></a>Seeking higher margins
      </p>
      <p class="calibre27">Targeting larger markets rather than smaller ones</p>
    </div>
      <p class="p">Disruptive technologies, however, are distinctly different from sustaining technologies. Disruptive technologies change the
         value proposition in a market. When they first appear, they almost always offer lower performance in terms of the attributes
         that mainstream customers care about. In computer disk drives, for example, disruptive technologies have always had less capacity
         than the old technologies. But disruptive technologies have other attributes that a few fringe (generally new) customers value.
         They are typically cheaper, smaller, simpler, and frequently more convenient to use. Therefore, they open new markets. Further,
         because with experience and sufficient investment, the developers of disruptive technologies will always improve their products’
         performance, they eventually are able to take over the older markets. This is because they are able to deliver sufficient
         performance on the old attributers, and they add some new ones.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre2">The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> describes both the processes through which disruptive technologies supplant older technologies and the powerful forces within
         well-managed companies that make them unlikely to develop those technologies themselves. Professor Christensen offers a framework
         of four Principles of Disruptive Technology to explain why the management practices that are the most productive for exploiting
         existing technologies are antiproductive when it comes to developing disruptive ones. And, finally, he suggests ways that
         managers can harness these principles so that their companies can become more effective at developing for themselves the new
         technologies that are going to capture their markets in the future.
