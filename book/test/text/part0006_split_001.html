<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_1">HOW DISK DRIVES WORK</h1>
      <p class="p">Disk drives write and read information that computers use. They comprise read-write heads mounted at the end of an arm that
         swings over the surface of a rotating disk in much the same way that a phonograph needle and arm reach over a record; aluminum
         or glass disks coated with magnetic material; at least two electric motors, a spin motor that drives the rotation of the disks
         and an actuator motor that moves the head to the desired position over the disk; and a variety of electronic circuits that
         control the drive’s operation and its interface with the computer. See Figure 1.1 for an illustration of a typical disk drive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The read-write head is a tiny electromagnet whose polarity changes whenever the direction of the electrical current running
         through it changes. Because opposite magnetic poles attract, when the polarity of the head becomes positive, the polarity
         of the area on the disk beneath the head switches to negative, and vice versa. By rapidly changing the direction of current
         flowing through the head’s electromagnet as the disk spins beneath the head, a sequence of positively and negatively oriented
         magnetic domains are created in concentric tracks on the disk’s surface. Disk drives can use the positive and negative domains
         on the disk as a binary numeric system—<em class="calibre2">1</em> and <em class="calibre2">0</em>—to “write” information onto disks. Drives read information from disks in essentially the opposite process: Changes in the
         magnetic flux fields on the disk surface induce changes in the micro current flowing through the head.
