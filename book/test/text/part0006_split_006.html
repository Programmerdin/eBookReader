      <p class="p">Why were the leading drive makers unable to launch 8-inch drives until it was too late? Clearly, they were technologically
         capable of producing these drives. Their failure resulted from delay in making the strategic commitment to enter the emerging
         market in which the 8-inch drives initially could be sold. Interviews with marketing and engineering executives close to these
         companies suggest that the established 14-inch drive manufacturers were held captive by customers. Mainframe computer manufacturers
         did not need an 8-inch drive. In fact, they explicitly did not want it: they wanted drives with increased capacity at a lower
         cost per megabyte. The 14-inch drive manufacturers were listening and responding to their established customers. And their
         customers—in a way that was not apparent to either the disk drive manufacturers or their computer-making customers—were pulling
         them along a trajectory of 22 percent capacity growth in a 14-inch platform that would ultimately prove fatal.

      <p class="calibre5">Figure 1.7 maps the disparate trajectories of performance improvement demanded in the computer product segments that emerged
         later, compared to the capacity that changes in component technology and refinements 
         <a id="page19"></a>in system design made available within each successive architecture. The solid lines emanating from points A, B, C, D, and
         E measure the disk drive capacity provided with the median-priced computer in each category, while the dotted lines from the
         same points measure the average capacity of all disk drives introduced for sale in each architecture, for each year. These
         transitions are briefly described below.
