<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_4">COMPANY SIZE AND LEADERSHIP IN DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
 <p class="p">Despite evidence that leadership in disruptive innovation pays such huge dividends, established firms, as shown in the first
  four chapters of this book, often fail to take the lead. Customers of established firms can hold the organizations captive,
  working through rational, well-functioning resource allocation processes to keep them from commercializing disruptive technologies.
  One cruel <em class="calibre2">additional</em> disabling factor that afflicts established firms as they work to maintain their growth rate is that the larger and more successful
  they become, the more difficult it is to muster the rationale for entering an emerging market in its early stages, when the
  evidence above shows that entry is so crucial.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Good managers are driven to keep their organizations growing for many reasons. One is that growth rates have a strong effect
  on share prices. To the extent that a company’s stock price represents the discounted present value of some consensus forecast
  of its future earnings stream, then the <em class="calibre2">level</em> of the stock price—whether it goes up or down—is driven by changes in the projected <em class="calibre2">rate of growth</em> in earnings.
  <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_9">9</a></sup>
  <a id="endnote_reference_9"></a> In other words, if a company’s current share price is predicated on a consensus growth forecast of 20 percent, and the market’s
  consensus for growth is subsequently revised downward to 15 percent growth, then the company’s share price will likely <em class="calibre2">fall</em>—even though its revenues and earnings will 
  <a id="page129"></a>still be growing at a healthy rate. A strong and increasing stock price, of course, gives a company access to capital on favorable
  terms; happy investors are a great asset to a company.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Rising share prices make stock option plans an inexpensive way to provide incentive to and to reward valuable employees. When
  share prices stagnate or fall, options lose their value. In addition, company growth creates room at the top for high-performing
  employees to expand the scope of their responsibilities. When companies stop growing, they begin losing many of their most
  promising future leaders, who see less opportunity for advancement.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Finally, there is substantial evidence that growing companies find it much easier to justify investments in new product and
  process technologies than do companies whose growth has stopped.
  <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0012_split_009.html#endnote_text_10">10</a></sup>
  <a id="endnote_reference_10"></a>
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, companies that become large and successful find that maintaining growth becomes progressively more difficult.
  The math is simple: A $40 million company that needs to grow profitably at 20 percent to sustain its stock price and organizational
  vitality needs an additional $8 million in revenues the first year, $9.6 million the following year, and so on; a $400 million
  company with a 20 percent targeted growth rate needs new business worth $80 million in the first year, $96 million in the
  next, and so on; and a $4 billion company with a 20 percent goal needs to find $800 million, $960 million, and so on, in each
  successive year.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">This problem is particularly vexing for big companies confronting disruptive technologies. Disruptive technologies facilitate
  the emergence of new markets, and there are no $800 million emerging markets. But it is precisely when emerging markets are
  small—when they are <em class="calibre2">least</em> attractive to large companies in search of big chunks of new revenue—that entry into them is so critical.
 </p>
 <p class="calibre5">How can a manager of a large, successful company deal with these realities of size and growth when confronted by disruptive
  change? I have observed three approaches in my study of this problem:
 </p>
<ol class="calibre17">
<li value="1" class="calibre18">Try to affect the growth rate of the emerging market, so that it becomes big enough, fast enough, to make a meaningful
  dent on the trajectory of profit and revenue growth of a large company.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre19">Wait until the market has emerged and become better defined, and then enter after it “has become large enough to be
  interesting.”</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre20">Place responsibility to commercialize disruptive technologies in organizations small enough that their performance
  will be meaningfully 
  <a id="page130"></a>affected by the revenues, profits, and small orders flowing from the disruptive business in its earliest years.</li>
</ol>
 <p class="spb">As the following case studies show, the first two approaches are fraught with problems. The third has its share of drawbacks
  too, but offers more evidence of promise.
