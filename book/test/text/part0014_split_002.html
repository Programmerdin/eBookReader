<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_2"><em class="calibre2">Resources</em></h2>
      <p class="p">Resources are the most visible of the factors that contribute to what an organization can and cannot do. Resources include
         people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors,
         and customers. Resources are usually <em class="calibre2">things</em>, or <em class="calibre2">assets</em>—they can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated or enhanced. They often can be transferred across the boundaries
         of organizations much more readily than can processes and values. Without doubt, access to abundant and high-quality resources
         enhances an organization’s chances of coping with change.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Resources are the things that managers most instinctively identify when assessing whether their organizations can successfully
         implement changes 
         <a id="page163"></a>that confront them. Yet resource analysis clearly does not tell a sufficient story about capabilities. Indeed, we could deal
         identical sets of resources to two different organizations, and what they created from those resources would likely be very
         different—because the capabilities to transform inputs into goods and services of greater value reside in the organization’s
         processes and values.
