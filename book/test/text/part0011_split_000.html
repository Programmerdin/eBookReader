      <h1 class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#chap-5" class="calibre4">Give Responsibility for Disruptive Technologies to Organizations Whose Customers Need Them</a></h1>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page101"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> Most executives would like to believe that they’re in charge of their organizations, that they make the crucial decisions
         and that when they decide that something should be done everyone snaps to and executes. This chapter expands on the view already
         introduced: that in practice, it is a company’s <em class="calibre2">customers</em> who effectively control what it can and cannot do. As we have seen in the disk drive industry, companies were willing to
         bet enormous amounts on technologically risky projects when it was clear that their customers needed the resulting products.
         But they were unable to muster the wherewithal to execute much simpler disruptive projects if existing, profitable customers
         didn’t need the products.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This observation supports a somewhat controversial theory called <em class="calibre2">resource dependence</em>, propounded by a minority of management scholars,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_1">1</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_1"></a> which posits that companies’ freedom of action is limited to satisfying the needs of those entities outside the firm (customers
         and investors, primarily) that give it the resources it needs to survive. Drawing heavily upon concepts from biological evolution,
         resource dependence theorists assert that organizations will survive and prosper only if their staffs and systems serve the
         needs of customers and investors by providing them with the products, services, and profit they require. Organizations that
         do not will ultimately die off, starved of the revenues they need to survive.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0011_split_010.html#endnote_text_2">2</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_2"></a>
         <a id="page102"></a>Hence, through this survival-of-the-fittest mechanism, those firms that rise to prominence in their industries generally will
         be those whose people and processes are most keenly tuned to giving their customers what they want. The controversy with this
         theory arises when its proponents conclude that managers are <em class="calibre2">powerless</em> to change the courses of their firms against the dictates of their customers. Even if a manager has a bold vision to take
         her or his company in a very different direction, the power of the customer-focused people and processes in any company well-adapted
         to survival in its competitive environment will reject the manager’s attempts to change direction. Therefore, because they
         provide the resources upon which the firm is dependent, it is the customers, rather than the managers, who really determine
         what a firm will do. It is forces outside the organization, rather than the managers within it, that dictate the company’s
         course. Resource dependence theorists conclude that the real role of managers in companies whose people and systems are well-adapted
         to survival is, therefore, only a symbolic one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">For those of us who have managed companies, consulted for management, or taught future managers, this is a most disquieting
         thought. We are there to manage, to make a difference, to formulate and implement strategy, to accelerate growth and improve
         profits. Resource dependence violates our very reason for being. Nonetheless, the findings reported in this book provide rather
         stunning support for the theory of resource dependence—especially for the notion that the customer-focused resource allocation
         and decision-making processes of successful companies are far more powerful in directing investments than are executives’
         decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Clearly, customers wield enormous power in directing a firm’s investments. What, then, should managers do when faced with
         a disruptive technology that the company’s customers explicitly do not want? One option is to convince everyone in the firm
         that the company should pursue it anyway, that it has long-term strategic importance despite rejection by the customers who
         pay the bills and despite lower profitability than the upmarket alternatives. The other option would be to create an independent
         organization and embed it among emerging customers that <em class="calibre2">do</em> need the technology. Which works best?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Managers who choose the first option essentially are picking a fight with a powerful tendency of organizational nature—that
         customers, not managers, essentially control the investment patterns of a company. By contrast, managers who choose the second
         option align themselves with this tendency, harnessing rather than fighting its power. The cases presented 
         <a id="page103"></a>in this chapter provide strong evidence that the second option offers far higher probabilities of success than the first.
