         way the world works and then position or align ourselves in harmony with those laws, is of course not new to this book. At
         a light-hearted level, Stanford Professor Robert Burgelman, whose work is extensively cited in ths book, once dropped his
         pen onto the floor in a lecture. He muttered as he stooped to pick it up, “I hate gravity.” Then, as he walked to the blackboard
         to continue his line of thought, he added, “But do you know what? Gravity doesn’t care! It will always pull things down, and
         I may as well plan on it.”

      <p class="ntx">        At a more serious level, the desirability of aligning our actions with the amore powerful laws of nature, society, and psychology,
         in order to lead a productive life, is a central theme in many works, particularly the ancient Chinese classic, <em class="calibre2">Tao te Ching.</em></p>
