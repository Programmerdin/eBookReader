<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_8"><em class="calibre2">Plans to Learn versus Plans to Execute</em></h2>
      <p class="p">Because failure is intrinsic to the search for initial market applications for disruptive technologies, managers need an approach
         very different from what they would take toward a sustaining technology. In general, for sustaining technologies, plans must
         be made before action is taken, forecasts can be accurate, and customer inputs can be reasonably reliable. Careful planning,
         followed by aggressive execution, is the right formula for success in sustaining technology.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">But in disruptive situations, action must be taken before careful plans are made. Because much less can be known about what
         markets need or how large they can become, plans must serve a very different purpose: They must be plans for <em class="calibre2">learning</em> rather than plans for implementation. By approaching a disruptive business with the mindset that they can’t know where the
         market is, managers would identify what critical information about new markets is most necessary and in what sequence that
         information is needed. Project and business plans would mirror those priorities, so that key pieces of information would be
         created, or important 
         <a id="page157"></a>uncertainties resolved, before expensive commitments of capital, time, and money were required.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre2">Discovery-driven planning</em>, which requires managers to identify the assumptions upon which their business plans or aspirations are based,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0013_split_009.html#endnote_text_11">11</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_11"></a> works well in addressing disruptive technologies. In the case of Hewlett-Packard’s Kittyhawk disk drive, for example, HP
         invested significant sums with its manufacturing partner, the Citizen Watch Company, in building and tooling a highly automated
         production line. This commitment was based on an assumption that the volumes forecast for the drive, built around forecasts
         by HP customers of PDA sales, were accurate. Had HP’s managers instead assumed that nobody knew in what volume PDAs would
         sell, they might have built small modules of production capacity rather than a single, high-volume line. They could then have
         held to capacity or added or reduced capacity as key events confirmed or disproved their assumptions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Similarly, the Kittyhawk product development plan was based on an assumption that the dominant application for the little
         drive was in PDAs, which demanded high ruggedness. Based on this assumption, the Kittyhawk team committed to components and
         a product architecture that made the product too expensive to be sold to the price-sensitive video game makers at the emerging
         low end of the market. Discovery-driven planning would have forced the team to test its market assumptions <em class="calibre2">before</em> making commitments that were expensive to reverse—in this case, possibly by creating a modularized design that easily could
         be reconfigured or defeatured to address different markets and price points, as events in the marketplace clarified the validity
         of their assumptions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Philosophies such as <em class="calibre2">management by objective</em> and <em class="calibre2">management by exception</em> often impede the discovery of new markets because of where they focus management attention. Typically, when performance falls
         short of plan, these systems encourage management to close the gap between what was planned and what happened. That is, they
         focus on unanticipated failures. But as Honda’s experience in the North American motorcycle market illustrates, markets for
         disruptive technologies often emerge from unanticipated successes, on which many planning systems do not focus the attention
         of senior management.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0013_split_009.html#endnote_text_12">12</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_12"></a> Such discoveries often come by watching how people use products, rather than by listening to what they say.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">I have come to call this approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies <em class="calibre2">agnostic marketing</em>, by which I mean marketing 
         <a id="page158"></a>under an explicit assumption that <em class="calibre2">no one</em>—not us, not our customers—can know whether, how, or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used before they
         have experience using it. Some managers, faced with such uncertainty, prefer to wait until others have defined the market.
         Given the powerful first-mover advantages at stake, however, managers confronting disruptive technologies need to get out
         of their laboratories and focus groups and directly create knowledge about new customers and new applications through discovery-driven
         expeditions into the marketplace.
