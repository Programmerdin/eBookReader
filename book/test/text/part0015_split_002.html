<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_2">WHEN DOES A PRODUCT BECOME A COMMODITY?</h1>
      <p class="p">The process of commoditization of disk drives was defined by the interplay between the trajectories of what the market demanded
         and what the technology supplied. The 5.25-inch drive had become a price-driven commodity in the desktop market by about 1988,
         when the 3.5-inch drive was still at a premium price. The 5.25-inch drive, in addition, even though priced as a commodity
         in desktop applications, was at the same time, relative to 8-inch drives, achieving substantial price premiums in higher-tier
         markets. As described in <a href="part0009_split_000.html">chapter 4</a>, this explains the aggressive moves upmarket made by established companies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">A product becomes a commodity within a specific market segment when the repeated changes in the basis of competition, as described
         above, completely play themselves out, that is, when market needs on each attribute or dimension of performance have been
         fully satisfied by more than one available product. The performance oversupply framework may help consultants, managers, and
         researchers to understand the frustrated comments they regularly hear from salespeople beaten down in price negotiations with
         customers: “Those stupid guys are just treating our product like it was a commodity. Can’t they see how much better our product
         is than the competition’s?” It may, in fact, be the case that the product offerings of competitors in a market continue to
         be differentiated from each other. But differentiation loses its meaning when the features and functionality have exceeded
         what the market demands.
