      <p class="p">Our technology plan cannot call for any technological breakthroughs on the path critical for the project’s success. Historically,
         disruptive technologies involve no new technologies; rather, they consist of components built around proven technologies and
         put together in a novel product architecture that offers the customer a set of attributes never before available.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The major automakers engaged in electric vehicle development today all maintain that a breakthrough in battery technology
         is absolutely essential before electric vehicles can be commercially viable. John R. Wallace, of Ford, for example, has stated
         the following:
      </p>
      <p class="ext">The dilemma is that today’s batteries cannot satisfy these consumer needs. As anybody who is familiar with today’s battery
         technology will tell you, electric vehicles are not ready for prime time. All of the batteries expected to be available in
         1998 fall short of the 100-mile range [required by consumers]. The only solution for the problems of range and cost is improved
         battery technology. To ensure a commercially successful electric vehicle market, the focus of our resources should be on the
         development of battery technology. Industry efforts such as those through the U.S. Advanced Battery consortium, along with
         cooperative efforts among all electric vehicle stakeholders—such as utilities, battery companies, environmentalists, regulators
         and converters— are the most effective way to ensure the marketability of electric vehicles.

      </p>
      <p class="p1">William Glaub, of Chrysler, takes a similar position: “The advanced lead-acid batteries that will be used will provide less
         than the fuel storage equivalent of two gallons of gasoline. This is like leaving home every day with the ‘low fuel’ light
         on. In other words, the battery technology is simply not ready.”
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_19">19</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_19"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The reason these companies view a breakthrough in battery technology as the critical bottleneck to the commercial success
         of electric vehicles, of course, is that their executives have positioned their minds and their products in the mainstream
         market. For Chrysler, this means an electric minivan; for Ford, an electric Ranger. Given this position, they must deliver
         a sustaining technological impact from what is inherently a disruptive technology. They need a breakthrough in battery technology
         because they 
         <a id="page216"></a>made the choice to somehow position electric vehicles as a sustaining technology. A battery breakthrough is <em class="calibre2">not</em> likely to be required of companies whose executives choose to harness or account for the basic laws of disruptive technology
         by creating a market in which the weaknesses of the electric vehicle become its strengths.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Where will advances in battery technology eventually come from? Looking at the historical record, we can assert the following.
         The companies that ultimately achieve the advances in battery technology required to power cars for 150-mile cruises (if they
         are ever developed) will be those that pioneer the creation of a new value network using proven technology and then develop
         the sustaining technologies needed to carry them upward into more attractive markets.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_20">20</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_20"></a> Our finding that well-managed companies are generally upwardly mobile and downwardly immobile, therefore, suggests that the
         impetus to find the battery breakthrough will indeed be strongest among the disruptive innovators, which will have built a
         lowend market for electric vehicles before trying to move upmarket toward the larger, more profitable mainstream.
