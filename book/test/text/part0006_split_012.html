      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_8"><a href="part0006_split_000.html#endnote_reference_8">1.</a> A more complete history of the disk drive industry can be found in Clayton M. Christensen, “The Rigid Disk Drive Industry:
         A History of Commercial and Technological Turbulence,” <em class="calibre2">Business History Review</em> (67), Winter, 1993, 531–588. This history focuses only on the manufacturers of rigid disk drives or hard drives—products
         on which data are stored on rigid metal platters. Companies manufacturing floppy disk drives (removable diskettes of flexible
         mylar coated with iron oxide on which data are stored) historically were different firms from those making hard disk drives.

         <a id="page26"></a>Much of the data for this analysis came from <em class="calibre2">Disk/Trend Report</em>, a highly respected annual market research publication, augmented with more detailed product-specification sheets obtained
         from the disk drive manufacturers themselves. I am grateful to the editors and staff at Disk/Trend, Inc., for their patient
         and generous assistance in this project.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_11"><a href="part0006_split_003.html#endnote_reference_11">4.</a> The ways in which the findings of this study differ from those of some earlier scholars of technology change while building
         upon those of others are discussed in greater detail in <a href="part0007_split_000.html">chapter 2</a>.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_12"><a href="part0006_split_004.html#endnote_reference_12">5.</a> The first technology for making heads built an electromagnet by wrapping a fine thread of copper wire around a core of
         iron oxide (ferrite); hence the term <em class="calibre2">ferrite head.</em> Incremental improvements to this approach involved learning to grind the ferrite to finer and finer dimensions, using better
         lapping techniques, and strengthening the ferrite by doping it with barium. <em class="calibre2">Thin-film heads</em> were made photolithographically, using technology similar to that used in making integrated circuits on silicon wafers to
         etch the electromagnet on the surface of the head. This was difficult because it involved much thicker layers of material
         than were common in IC manufacturing. The third technology, adopted starting in the mid-1990s, was called <em class="calibre2">magneto-resistive heads.</em> These were also made with thin-film photolithography, but used the principle that changes in the magnetic flux field on the
         disk surface changed the electrical resistivity of the circuitry in the head. By measuring changes in resistivity rather than
         changes in the direction of current flow, magneto-resistive heads were much more sensitive, and hence permitted denser data
         recording, than prior technology. In the evolution of disk technology, the earliest disks were made by coating fine needle-shaped
         particles of iron oxide—literally rust—over the surface of a flat, polished aluminum platter. Hence, these disks were called
         <em class="calibre2">oxide</em> disks. Incremental improvements to this technology involved making finer and finer iron oxide particles, and dispersing them
         more uniformly, with fewer uncoated voids on the aluminum platter’s surface. This was supplanted by a sputtering technology,
         also borrowed from semiconductor processing, that coated the aluminum platter with a thin film of metal a few angstroms thick.
         The thinness of this layer; its continuous, rather than particulate nature; and the process’s flexibility in depositing magnetic
         materials with higher coercivity, enabled denser recording on thin-film disks than was feasible on oxide disks.

      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_14"><a href="part0006_split_004.html#endnote_reference_14">7.</a> The examples of technology change presented in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 introduce 
         <a id="page27"></a>some ambiguity to the unqualified term <em class="calibre2">discontinuity</em>, as used by Giovanni Dosi (see “Technological Paradigms and Technological Trajectories,” <em class="calibre2">Research Policy</em> [11] 1982), Michael L. Tushman and Philip Anderson (see “Technological Discontinuities and Organizational Environments,”
         <em class="calibre2">Administrative Science Quarterly</em> [31], 1986), and others. The innovations in head and disk technology described in Figure 1.4 represent <em class="calibre2">positive</em> discontinuities in an established technological trajectory, while the trajectory-disrupting technologies charted in Figure
         1.7 represent <em class="calibre2">negative</em> discontinuities. As will be shown below, established firms seemed quite capable of leading the industry over positive discontinuities,
         but generally lost their industry lead when faced with negative discontinuities. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntx" id="endnote_text_15"><a href="part0006_split_005.html#endnote_reference_15">8.</a> This tendency consistently appears across a range of industries. Richard S. Rosenbloom and Clayton M. Christensen (in “Technological
         Discontinuities, Organizational Capabilities, and Strategic Commitments,” <em class="calibre2">Industrial and Corporate Change</em> [3], 1994, 655–685) suggest a much broader set of industries in which leading firms may have been toppled by technologically
         straightforward disruptive innovations than is covered in this book.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_17"><a href="part0006_split_005.html#endnote_reference_17">10.</a> The minicomputer market was not new in 1978, but it was a new application for Winchester-technology disk drives. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_18"><a href="part0006_split_005.html#endnote_reference_18">11.</a> This statement applies only to independent drive makers competing in the OEM market. Some of the vertically integrated
         computer makers, such as IBM, have survived across these generations with the benefit of a captive internal market. Even IBM,
         however, addressed the sequence of different emerging markets for disk drives by creating autonomous “start-up” disk drive
         organizations to address each one. Its San Jose organization focused on high-end (primarily mainframe) applications. A separate
         division in Rochester, MN, focused on mid-range computers and workstations. IBM created a different organization in Fujisawa,
         Japan, to produce drives for the desktop personal computer market.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_19"><a href="part0006_split_005.html#endnote_reference_19">12.</a> This result is very different from that observed by Rebecca M. Henderson (see <em class="calibre2">The Failure of Established Firms in the Face of Technological Change: A Study of the Semiconductor Photolithographic Alignment
            Industry</em>, dissertation, Harvard University, 1988), who found the new-architecture aligners produced by the established manufacturers
         to be inferior in performance to those produced by entrant firms. One possible reason for these different results is that
         the successful entrants in the photolithographic aligner industry studied by Henderson brought to the new product a well-developed
         body of technological knowledge and experience developed and refined in other markets. In the case studied here, none of the
         entrants brought such well-developed 
         <a id="page28"></a>knowledge with them. Most, in fact, were <em class="calibre2">de novo</em> start-ups composed of managers and engineers who had defected from established drive manufacturing firms. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_20"><a href="part0006_split_006.html#endnote_reference_20">13.</a> This finding is similar to the phenomenon observed by Joseph L. Bower, who saw that explicit customer demands have tremendous
         power as a source of impetus in the resource allocation process: “When the discrepancy (the problem to be solved by a proposed
         investment) was defined in terms of cost and quality, the projects languished. In all four cases, the definition process moved
         toward completion when capacity to meet sales was perceived to be inadequate…. In short, pressure from the market reduces
         both the probability and the cost of being wrong.” Although Bower specifically refers to manufacturing capacity, the same
         fundamental phenomenon—the power of the known needs of known customers in marshaling and directing the investments of a firm—affects
         response to disruptive technology. See Joseph L. Bower, <em class="calibre2">Managing the Resource Allocation Process</em> (Homewood, IL: Richard D. Irwin, 1970) 254.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_21"><a href="part0006_split_008.html#endnote_reference_21">14.</a> In booking $113 million in revenues, Conner Peripherals set a record for booking more revenues in its first year of operation
         than any manufacturing company in United States history. 
         
      </p>
      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_22"><a href="part0006_split_008.html#endnote_reference_22">15.</a> This finding is consistent with what Robert Burgelman has observed. He noted that one of the greatest difficulties encountered
         by corporate entrepreneurs has been finding the right “beta test sites” where products could be interactively developed and
         refined with customers. Generally, a new venture’s entrée to the customer was provided by the salesperson representing the
         firm’s established product lines. This helped the firm develop new products for established markets but not to identify new
         applications for new technology. See Robert A. Burgelman and Leonard Sayles, <em class="calibre2">Inside Corporate Innovation</em> (New York: The Free Press, 1986) 76–80.

      <p class="ntxn" id="endnote_text_23"><a href="part0006_split_010.html#endnote_reference_23">16.</a> I believe this insight—that attacking firms have an advantage in disruptive innovations but not in sustaining ones—clarifies,
         but is not in conflict with, Foster’s assertions about the attacker’s advantage. The historical examples Foster uses to substantiate
         his theory generally seem to have been disruptive innovations. See Richard J. Foster, <em class="calibre2">Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage</em> (New York: Summit Books, 1986).
