         <a id="page143"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> Markets that do not exist cannot be analyzed: Suppliers and customers must discover them together. Not only are the market
         applications for disruptive technologies <em class="calibre2">unknown</em> at the time of their development, they are <em class="calibre2">unknowable.</em> The strategies and plans that managers formulate for confronting disruptive technological change, therefore, should be plans
         for learning and discovery rather than plans for execution. This is an important point to understand, because managers who
         believe they know a marketâ€™s future will plan and invest very differently from those who recognize the uncertainties of a
         developing market.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Most managers learn about innovation in a <em class="calibre2">sustaining technology context</em> because most technologies developed by established companies are sustaining in character. Such innovations are, by definition,
         targeted at known markets in which customer needs are understood. In this environment, a planned, researched approach to evaluating,
         developing, and marketing innovative products is not only possible, it is critical to success.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">What this means, however, is that much of what the best executives in successful companies have learned about managing innovation
         is not relevant to disruptive technologies. Most marketers, for example, have been schooled extensively, at universities and
         on the job, in the important art of listening to their customers, but few have any theoretical or practical training in how
         to discover markets that do not yet exist. The problem 
         <a id="page144"></a>with this lopsided experience base is that when the same analytical and decision-making processes learned in the school of
         sustaining innovation are applied to enabling or disruptive technologies, the effect on the company can be paralyzing. These
         processes demand crisply quantified information when none exists, accurate estimates of financial returns when neither revenues
         nor costs can be known, and management according to detailed plans and budgets that cannot be formulated. Applying inappropriate
         marketing, investment, and management processes can render good companies incapable of creating the new markets in which enabling
         or disruptive technologies are first used.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In this chapter we shall see how experts in the disk drive industry were able to forecast the markets for sustaining technologies
         with stunning accuracy but had great difficulty in spotting the advent and predicting the size of new markets for disruptive
         innovations. Additional case histories in the motorcycle and microprocessor industries further demonstrate the uncertainty
         about emerging market applications for disruptive or enabling technologies, even those that, in retrospect, appear obvious.
