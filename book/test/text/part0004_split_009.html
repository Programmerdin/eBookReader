<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_9"><em class="calibre2">Principle #1: Companies Depend on Customers and Investors for<br class="calibre1"/>Resources</em></h2>
      <p class="p">The history of the disk drive industry shows that the established firms stayed atop wave after wave of sustaining technologies
         (technologies that their customers needed), while consistently stumbling over simpler disruptive ones. This evidence supports
         the <em class="calibre2">theory of resource dependence.</em><sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0004_split_016.html#endnote_text_7">7</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_7"></a> <a href="part0011_split_000.html">Chapter 5</a> summarizes this theory, which states that while managers may <em class="calibre2">think</em> they control the flow of resources in their firms, in the end it is really customers and investors who dictate how money
         will be spent because companies with investment patterns that don’t satisfy their customers and investors don’t survive. The
         highest-performing companies, in fact, are those that are the best at this, that is, they have well-developed systems for
         killing ideas that their customers don’t want. As a result, these companies find it very difficult to invest adequate resources
         in disruptive 
         <a id="pagexx"></a>technologies—lower-margin opportunities that their customers don’t want—until their customers want them. And by then it is
         too late.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5"><a href="part0011_split_000.html">Chapter 5</a> suggests a way for managers to align or harness this law with their efforts to confront disruptive technology. With
         few exceptions, the only instances in which mainstream firms have successfully established a timely position in a disruptive
         technology were those in which the firms’ managers set up an autonomous organization charged with building a new and independent
         business around the disruptive technology. Such organizations, free of the power of the customers of the mainstream company,
         ensconce themselves among a different set of customers—those who <em class="calibre2">want</em> the products of the disruptive technology. In other words, companies can succeed in disruptive technologies when their managers
         align their organizations <em class="calibre2">with</em> the forces of resource dependence, rather than ignoring or fighting them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The implication of this principle for managers is that, when faced with a threatening disruptive technology, people and processes
         in a mainstream organization cannot be expected to allocate freely the critical financial and human resources needed to carve
         out a strong position in the small, emerging market. It is very difficult for a company whose cost structure is tailored to
         compete in high-end markets to be profitable in low-end markets as well. Creating an independent organization, with a cost
         structure honed to achieve profitability at the low margins characteristic of most disruptive technologies, is the only viable
         way for established firms to harness this principle.
