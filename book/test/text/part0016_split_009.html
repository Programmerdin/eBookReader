<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_9"><em class="calibre2">Spinning Off an Independent Organization</em></h2>
      <p class="p">As we saw in the discussion of resource dependence in <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapter 5</a>, established firms that successfully built a strong market
         position in a disruptive technology were those that spun off from the mainstream company an independent, autonomously operated
         organization. Quantum, Control Data, IBM’s PC Division, Allen Bradley, and Hewlett-Packard’s desk-jet initiative all succeeded
         because they created organizations whose survival was predicated upon successful commercialization of the disruptive technology:
         These firms embedded a dedicated organization squarely within the emerging value network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As program manager, therefore, I would strongly urge corporate management to create an independent organization to commercialize
         electric vehicle technology, either an autonomous business unit, such as GM’s Saturn Division or the IBM PC Division, or an
         independent company 
         <a id="page218"></a>whose stock is largely owned by the corporation. In an independent organization, my best employees would be able to focus
         on electric vehicles without being repeatedly withdrawn from the project to solve pressing problems for customers who pay
         the present bills. Demands from our own customers, on the other hand, would help us to focus on and lend impetus and excitement
         to our program.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">An independent organization would not only make resource dependence work for us rather than against us, but it would also
         address the principle that small markets cannot solve the growth or profit problems of large companies. For many years into
         the future, the market for electric vehicles will be so small that this business is unlikely to contribute significantly to
         the top or bottom lines of a major automaker’s income statement. Thus, since senior managers at these companies cannot be
         expected to focus either their priority attention or their priority resources on electric vehicles, the most talented managers
         and engineers would be unlikely to want to be associated with our project, which must inevitably be seen as a financially
         insignificant effort: To secure their own futures within the company, they naturally will want to work on mainstream programs,
         not peripheral ones.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In the early years of this new business, orders are likely to be denominated in hundreds, not tens of thousands. If we are
         lucky enough to get a few wins, they almost surely will be small ones. In a small, independent organization, these small wins
         will generate energy and enthusiasm. In the mainstream, they would generate skepticism about whether we should even be in
         the business. I want my organization’s <em class="calibre2">customers</em> to answer the question of whether we should be in the business. I don’t want to spend my precious managerial energy constantly
         defending our existence to efficiency analysts in the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Innovations are fraught with difficulties and uncertainties. Because of this, I want <em class="calibre2">always</em> to be sure that the projects that I manage are positioned directly on the path everyone believes the organization must take
         to achieve higher growth and greater profitability. If my program is widely viewed as being on that path, then I have confidence
         that when the inevitable problems arise, somehow the organization will work with me to muster whatever it takes to solve them
         and succeed. If, on the other hand, my program is viewed by key people as nonessential to the organization’s growth and profitability,
         or even worse, is viewed as an idea that might <em class="calibre2">erode</em> profits, then even if the technology is simple, the project will fail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">I can address this challenge in one of two ways: I could convince 
         <a id="page219"></a>everyone in the mainstream (in their heads <em class="calibre2">and</em> their guts) that the disruptive technology is profitable, or I could create an organization that is small enough, with an
         appropriate cost structure, that my program can be viewed as being on its critical path to success. The latter alternative
         is a far more tractable management challenge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In a small, independent organization I will more likely be able to create an appropriate attitude toward failure. Our initial
         stab into the market is not likely to be successful. We will, therefore, need the flexibility to fail, but to fail on a <em class="calibre2">small</em> scale, so that we can try again without having destroyed our credibility. Again, there are two ways to create the proper
         tolerance toward failure: change the values and culture of the mainstream organization or create a new organization. The problem
         with asking the mainstream organization to be more tolerant of risk-taking and failure is that, in general, we don’t <em class="calibre2">want</em> to tolerate marketing failure when, as is most often the case, we are investing in sustaining technology change. The mainstream
         organization is involved in taking sustaining technological innovations into existing markets populated by known customers
         with researchable needs. Getting it wrong the first time is not an intrinsic part of these processes: Such innovations are
         amenable to careful planning and coordinated execution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Finally, I don’t want my organization to have pockets that are too deep. While I don’t want my people to feel pressure to
         generate significant profit for the mainstream company (this would force us into a fruitless search for an instant large market),
         I want them to feel <em class="calibre2">constant</em> pressure to find some way—<em class="calibre2">some</em> set of customers <em class="calibre2">somewhere</em>—to make our small organization cash-positive as fast as possible. We need a strong motivation to accelerate through the trials
         and errors inherent in cultivating a new market.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Of course, the danger in making this unequivocal call for spinning out an independent company is that some managers might
         apply this remedy indiscriminately, viewing skunkworks and spinoffs as a blanket solution—an industrial-strength aspirin that
         cures all sorts of problems. In reality, spinning out is an appropriate step only when confronting disruptive innovation.
         The evidence is <em class="calibre2">very</em> strong that large, mainstream organizations can be extremely creative in developing and implementing <em class="calibre2">sustaining</em> innovations.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0016_split_010.html#endnote_text_21">21</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_21"></a> In other words, the degree of disruptiveness inherent in an innovation provides a fairly clear indication of when a mainstream
         organization might be capable of succeeding with it and when it might be expected to fail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">In terms of the framework presented in Figure 5.6, the electric vehicle 
         <a id="page220"></a>is not only a disruptive innovation, but it involves massive architectural reconfiguration as well, a reconfiguration that
         must occur not only within the product itself but across the entire value chain. From procurement through distribution, functional
         groups will have to interface differently than they have ever before. Hence, my project would need to be managed as a heavyweight
         team in an organization independent of the mainstream company. This organizational structure cannot guarantee the success
         of our electric vehicle program, but it would at least allow my team to work in an environment that accounts for, rather than
         fights, the principles of disruptive innovation.
