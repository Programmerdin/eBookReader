<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_3"><em class="calibre2">Processes</em></h2>
      <p class="p">Organizations create value as employees transform inputs of resources— people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands,
         information, energy, and cash—into products and services of greater worth. The patterns of interaction, coordination, communication,
         and decision-making through which they accomplish these transformations are <em class="calibre2">processes</em>.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0014_split_013.html#endnote_text_3">3</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_3"></a> Processes include not just manufacturing processes, but those by which product development, procurement, market research,
         budgeting, planning, employee development and compensation, and resource allocation are accomplished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Processes differ not only in their purpose, but also in their visibility. Some processes are “formal,” in the sense that they
         are explicitly defined, visibly documented, and consciously followed. Other processes are “informal,” in that they are habitual
         routines or ways of working that have evolved over time, which people follow simply because they work—or because “That’s the
         way we do things around here.” Still other methods of working and interacting have proven so effective for so long that people
         unconsciously follow them—they constitute the culture of the organization. Whether they are formal, informal, or cultural,
         however, processes define how an organization transforms the sorts of inputs listed above into things of greater value.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Processes are defined or evolve <em class="calibre2">de facto</em> to address specific tasks. This means that when managers use a process to execute the tasks for which it was designed, it
         is likely to perform efficiently. But when the same, seemingly efficient process is employed to tackle a very different task,
         it is likely to seem slow, bureaucratic, and inefficient. In other words, a process that defines a <em class="calibre2">capability</em> in executing a certain task concurrently defines <em class="calibre2">disabilities</em> in executing other tasks.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0014_split_013.html#endnote_text_4">4</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_4"></a> The reason good managers strive for focus in their organizations is that processes and tasks can be readily aligned.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0014_split_013.html#endnote_text_5">5</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_5"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">One of the dilemmas of management is that, by their very nature, 
         <a id="page164"></a>processes are established so that employees perform recurrent tasks in a consistent way, time after time. To ensure consistency,
         they are meant <em class="calibre2">not</em> to change—or if they must change, to change through tightly controlled procedures. <em class="calibre2">This means that the very mechanisms through which organizations create value are intrinsically inimical to change</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Some of the most crucial processes to examine as capabilities or disabilities aren’t the obvious value-adding processes involved
         in logistics, development, manufacturing, and customer service. Rather, they are the enabling or background processes that
         support investment decision-making. As we saw in <a href="part0013_split_000.html">chapter 7</a>, the processes that render good companies incapable of responding
         to change are often those that define how market research is habitually done; how such analysis is translated into financial
         projections; how plans and budgets are negotiated and how those numbers are delivered; and so on. These typically inflexible
         processes are where many organizations’ most serious disabilities in coping with change reside.
