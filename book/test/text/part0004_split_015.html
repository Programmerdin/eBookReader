<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_15">WHERE DISRUPTIONS ARE HAPPENING TODAY</h1>
      <p class="p">One of the most gratifying aspects of my life since the first edition of <em class="calibre2">The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> was published has been the number of people who have called, representing industries that I had never thought about, who
         have suggested that forces similar to those historical examples I described in these pages are disrupting their industries
         as well. Some of these are described in the table on the previous page. Not surprisingly, the Internet looms as an infrastructural
         technology that is enabling the disruption of many industries.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Each of the innovations in the right column—in the form of a new technology or a new business model—is now in the process
         of disrupting the established order described in the left column. Will the companies that currently lead their industries
         using the technologies in the left column survive these attacks? My hope is that the future might be different than the past.
         I believe that the future <em class="calibre2">can</em> be different, if managers will recognize these disruptions for what they are, and address them in a way that accounts for
         or harnesses the fundamental principles described in the pages that follow.
