         <a id="page183"></a><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre3"/> The graphs in this book showing the intersecting technology and market trajectories have proven useful in explaining how leading
         firms can stumble from positions of industry leadership. In each of the several industries explored, technologists were able
         to provide rates of performance improvement that have exceeded the rates of performance improvement that the market has needed
         or was able to absorb. Historically, when this <em class="calibre2">performance oversupply</em> occurs, it creates an opportunity for a disruptive technology to emerge and subsequently to invade established markets from
         below.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As it creates this threat or opportunity for a disruptive technology, performance oversupply also triggers a fundamental change
         in the basis of competition in the product’s market: The rank-ordering of the criteria by which customers choose one product
         or service over another will change, signaling a transition from one phase (variously defined by management theorists) to
         the next of the product life cycle. In other words, the intersecting trajectories of performance supplied and performance
         demanded are fundamental triggers behind the phases in the product life cycle. Because of this, trajectory maps such as those
         used in this book usefully characterize how an industry’s competitive dynamics and its basis of competition are likely to
         change over time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As with past chapters, this discussion begins with an analysis from the 
         <a id="page184"></a>disk drive industry of what can happen when the performance supplied exceeds the market’s demands. After seeing the same phenomenon
         played out in the markets for accounting software and for diabetes care products, the link between this pattern and the phases
         of the product life cycle will be clear.
