      <p class="p">When the smaller models began to invade established market segments, the drive makers that had initially controlled those
         markets took their prototypes off the shelf (where they had been put in Step 3) and introduced them in order to defend their
         customer base in their own market. By this time, of course, the new architecture had shed its disruptive character and become
         fully performance-competitive with the larger drives in the established markets. Although some established manufacturers were
         able to defend their market positions through belated introduction of the new architecture, many found that the entrant firms
         had developed insurmountable advantages in manufacturing cost and design experience, and they eventually withdrew from the
         market. The firms attacking from value networks below brought with them cost structures set to achieve profitability at lower
         gross margins. The attackers therefore were able to price their products profitably, while the defending, established firms
         experienced a severe price war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">For established manufacturers that did succeed in introducing the new architectures, survival was the only reward. None ever
         won a significant share of the new market; the new drives simply cannibalized sales of older products to existing customers.
         Thus, as of 1991, almost none of Seagate’s 3.5-inch drives had been sold to portable/laptop manufacturers: Its 3.5-inch customers
         still were desktop computer manufacturers, and many of its 3.5-inch drives continued to be shipped with frames permitting
         them to be mounted in XT-and AT-class computers designed to accommodate 5.25-inch drives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Control Data, the 14-inch leader, never captured even a 1 percent share of the minicomputer market. It introduced its 8-inch
         drives nearly three years after the pioneering start-ups did, and nearly all of its drives were sold to its existing mainframe
         customers. Miniscribe, Quantum, and Micropolis all had the same cannibalistic experience when they belatedly introduced disruptive
         technology drives. They failed to capture a significant share of the new market, and at best succeeded in defending a portion
         of their prior business.
