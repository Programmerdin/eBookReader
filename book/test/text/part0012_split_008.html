<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_8">SUMMARY</h1>
  <p class="p">It is not crucial for managers pursuing growth and competitive advantage to be leaders in every element of their business.
   In sustaining technologies, in fact, evidence strongly suggests that companies which focus on extending the performance of
   conventional technologies, and choose to be followers in adopting new ones, can remain strong and competitive. This is not
   the case with disruptive technologies, however. There are enormous returns and significant first-mover advantages associated
   with early entry into the emerging markets in which disruptive technologies are initially used. Disk drive manufacturers that
   led in commercializing disruptive technology grew at vastly greater rates than did companies that were disruptive technology
   followers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">Despite the evidence that leadership in commercializing disruptive technologies is crucial, large, successful innovators encounter
   a significant 
   <a id="page138"></a>dilemma in the pursuit of such leadership. In addition to dealing with the power of present customers as discussed in the
   last chapter, large, growth-oriented companies face the problem that small markets donâ€™t solve the near-term growth needs
   of large companies. The markets whose emergence is enabled by disruptive technologies all began as small ones. The first orders
   that the pioneering companies received in those markets were small ones. And the companies that cultivated those markets had
   to develop cost structures enabling them to become profitable at small scale. Each of these factors argues for a policy of
   implanting projects to commercialize disruptive innovations in small organizations that will view the projects as being on
   their critical path to growth and success, rather than as being distractions from the main business of the company.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">This recommendation is not new, of course; a host of other management scholars have also argued that smallness and independence
   confer certain advantages in innovation. It is my hope that <a href="part0011_split_000.html">chapters 5</a> and <a href="part0012_split_000.html">6</a> provide deeper insight about why and under what
   circumstances this strategy is appropriate.
