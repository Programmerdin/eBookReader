<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_5">FAILURE IN THE FACE OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES</h1>
      <p class="p">Most technological change in the disk drive industry has consisted of sustaining innovations of the sort described above.
         In contrast, there have been only a few of the other sort of technological change, called disruptive technologies. These were
         the changes that toppled the industry’s leaders.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">
         <a id="page15"></a>The most important disruptive technologies were the architectural innovations that shrunk the size of the drives—from 14-inch
         diameter disks to diameters of 8, 5.25, and 3.5-inches and then from 2.5 to 1.8 inches. Table 1.1 illustrates the ways these
         innovations were disruptive. Based on 1981 data, it compares the attributes of a typical 5.25-inch drive, a new architecture
         that had been in the market for less than a year, with those of a typical 8-inch drive, which at that time was the standard
         drive used by minicomputer manufacturers. Along the dimensions of performance important to established minicomputer manufacturers—capacity,
         cost per megabyte, and access time—the 8-inch product was vastly superior. The 5.25-inch architecture did not address the
         perceived needs of minicomputer manufacturers at that time. On the other hand, the 5.25-inch drive had features that appealed
         to the desktop personal computer market segment just emerging in the period between 1980 and 1982. It was small and lightweight,
         and, priced at around $2,000, it could be incorporated into desktop machines economically.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward, consisting of off-the-shelf components put together
         in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches.

         <a id="endnote_reference_15"></a> They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. They offered
         a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and unimportant to, the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The trajectory map in Figure 1.7 shows how this series of simple but disruptive technologies proved to be the undoing of some
         very aggressive, astutely managed disk drive companies. Until the mid-1970s, 14-inch drives with removable packs of disks
         accounted for nearly all disk drive sales. The 14-inch Winchester architecture then emerged to sustain the trajectory of recording
         density improvement. Nearly all of these drives (removable disks and Winchesters) were sold to mainframe computer manufacturers,
         and the same companies that led the market in disk pack drives led the industry’s transition to the Winchester technology.

         <a id="page17"></a>The trajectory map shows that the hard disk capacity provided in the median priced, typically configured mainframe computer
         system in 1974 was about 130 MB per computer. This increased at a 15 percent annual rate over the next fifteen years—a trajectory
         representing the disk capacity demanded by the typical users of new mainframe computers. At the same time, the capacity of
         the average 14-inch drive introduced for sale each year increased at a faster, 22 percent rate, reaching beyond the mainframe
         market to the large scientific and supercomputer markets.

         <a id="endnote_reference_16"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Between 1978 and 1980, several entrant firms—Shugart Associates, Micropolis, Priam, and Quantum—developed smaller 8-inch drives
         with 10, 20, 30, and 40 MB capacity. These drives were of no interest to mainframe computer manufacturers, which at that time
         were demanding drives with 300 to 400 MB capacity. These 8-inch entrants therefore sold their disruptive drives into a new
         application—minicomputers.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0006_split_012.html#endnote_text_17">10</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_17"></a> The customers—Wang, DEC, Data General, Prime, and Hewlett-Packard—did not manufacture mainframes, and their customers often
         used software substantially different from that used in mainframes. These firms hitherto had been unable to offer disk drives
         in their small, desk-side minicomputers because 14-inch models were too big and expensive. Although initially the cost per
         megabyte of capacity of 8-inch drives was higher than that of 14-inch drives, these new customers were willing to pay a premium
         for other attributes that were important to them—especially smaller size. Smallness had little value to mainframe users.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Once the use of 8-inch drives became established in minicomputers, the hard disk capacity shipped with the median-priced minicomputer
         grew about 25 percent per year: a trajectory determined by the ways in which minicomputer owners learned to use their machines.
         At the same time, however, the 8-inch drive makers found that, by aggressively adopting sustaining innovations, they could
         increase the capacity of their products at a rate of more than 40 percent per year—nearly double the rate of increase demanded
         by their original “home” minicomputer market. In consequence, by the mid-1980s, 8-inch drive makers were able to provide the
         capacities required for lower-end mainframe computers. Unit volumes had grown significantly so that the cost per megabyte
         of 8-inch drives had declined below that of 14-inch drives, and other advantages became apparent: For example, the same percentage
         mechanical vibration in an 8-inch drive, as opposed to a 14-inch drive, caused much less variance in 
         <a id="page18"></a>the absolute position of the head over the disk. Within a three-to-four-year period, therefore, 8-inch drives began to invade
         the market above them, substituting for 14-inch drives in the lower-end mainframe computer market.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">As the 8-inch products penetrated the mainframe market, the established manufacturers of 14-inch drives began to fail. Two-thirds
         of them never introduced an 8-inch model. The one-third that introduced 8-inch models did so about two years behind the 8-inch
         entrant manufacturers. Ultimately, every 14-inch drive maker was driven from the industry.

         <a id="endnote_reference_18"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The 14-inch drive makers were not toppled by the 8-inch entrants because of technology. The 8-inch products generally incorporated
         standard off-the-shelf components, and when those 14-inch drive makers that did introduce 8-inch models got around to doing
         so, their products were very performance-competitive in capacity, areal density, access time, and price per megabyte. The
         8-inch models introduced by the established firms in 1981 were nearly identical in performance to the average of those introduced
         that year by the entrant firms. In addition, the rates of improvement in key attributes (measured between 1979 and 1983) were
         stunningly similar between established and entrant firms.
