      <p class="p">New companies, usually including frustrated engineers from established firms, were formed to exploit the disruptive product
         architecture. The founders of the leading 3.5-inch drive maker, Conner Peripherals, were disaffected employees from Seagate
         and Miniscribe, the two largest 5.25-inch manufacturers. The founders of 8-inch drive maker Micropolis came 
         <a id="page46"></a>from Pertec, a 14-inch drive manufacturer, and the founders of Shugart and Quantum defected from Memorex.

         <a id="endnote_reference_42"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The start-ups, however, were as unsuccessful as their former employers in attracting established computer makers to the disruptive
         architecture. Consequently, they had to find <em class="calibre2">new</em> customers. The applications that emerged in this very uncertain, probing process were the minicomputer, the desktop personal
         computer, and the laptop computer. In retrospect, these were obvious markets for hard drives, but at the time, their ultimate
         size and significance were highly uncertain. Micropolis was founded before the emergence of the desk-side minicomputer and
         word processor markets in which its products came to be used. Seagate began when personal computers were simple toys for hobbyists,
         two years before IBM introduced its PC. And Conner Peripherals got its start before Compaq knew the potential size of the
         portable computer market. The founders of these firms sold their products without a clear marketing strategyâ€” essentially
         selling to whoever would buy. Out of what was largely a trial-and-error approach to the market, the ultimately dominant applications
         for their products emerged.
