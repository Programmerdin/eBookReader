<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_1">ORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGERIAL EXPLANATIONS OF FAILURE</h1>
      <p class="p">One explanation for why good companies fail points to organizational impediments as the source of the problem. While many
         analyses of this type stop with such simple rationales as bureaucracy, complacency, or 
         <a id="page30"></a>“risk-averse” culture, some remarkably insightful studies exist in this tradition. Henderson and Clark,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_24">1</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_24"></a> for example, conclude that companies’ organizational structures typically facilitate component-level innovations, because
         most product development organizations consist of subgroups that correspond to a product’s components. Such systems work very
         well as long as the product’s fundamental architecture does not require change. But, say the authors, when architectural technology
         change is required, this type of structure impedes innovations that require people and groups to communicate and work together
         in new ways.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This notion has considerable face validity. In one incident recounted in Tracy Kidder’s Pulitzer Prize–winning narrative,
         <em class="calibre2">The Soul of a New Machine</em>, Data General engineers developing a next-generation minicomputer intended to leapfrog the product position of Digital Equipment
         Corporation were allowed by a friend of one team member into his facility in the middle of the night to examine Digital’s
         latest computer, which his company had just bought. When Tom West, Data General’s project leader and a former long-time Digital
         employee, removed the cover of the DEC minicomputer and examined its structure, he saw “Digital’s organization chart in the
         design of the product.”

         <a id="endnote_reference_25"></a>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Because an organization’s structure and how its groups work together may have been established to facilitate the design of
         its dominant product, the direction of causality may ultimately reverse itself: The organization’s structure and the way its
         groups learn to work together can then affect the way it can and cannot design new products.
