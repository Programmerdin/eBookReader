<h2 class="calibre8" id="calibre_pb_4"><em class="calibre2">The Emergence and Trajectory of Improvement of Hydraulic Excavation</em></h2>
      <p class="p">The first hydraulic excavator was developed by a British company, J. C. Bamford, in 1947. Similar products then emerged simultaneously
         in several American companies in the late 1940s, among them, the Henry Company, of Topeka, Kansas, and Sherman Products, Inc.,
         of Royal Oak, Michigan. The approach was labeled “Hydraulically Operated Power Take-Off,” yielding an acronym that became
         the name of the third entrant to hydraulic excavating in the late 1940s, HOPTO.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Their machines were called <em class="calibre2">backhoes</em> because they were mounted on the back of industrial or farm tractors. Backhoes excavated by extending the shovel out, pushing
         it down into the earth,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0008_split_008.html#endnote_text_58">10</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_58"></a> curling or articulating the shovel under the slice of earth, and lifting it up out of the hole. Limited by the power and
         strength of available hydraulic pumps’ seals, the capacity of these early machines was a mere ¼ cubic yard, as graphed in Figure 3.3. Their reach was also limited to about six feet. Whereas the best cable excavators could
         rotate a full 360 degrees on their track base, the most flexible backhoes could rotate only 180 degrees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">Because their capacity was so small and their reach so short, hydraulic excavators were of no use to mining, general excavation,
         or sewer contractors, who were demanding machines with buckets that held 1 to 4 cubic yards. As a result, the entrant firms
         had to develop a new application for their products. They began to sell their excavators as attachments for the back of small
         industrial and farm tractors made by Ford, J. I. Case, John Deere, International Harvester, and Massey Ferguson. Small residential
         contractors purchased these units to dig narrow ditches from water and sewer lines in the street to the foundations of houses
         under construction. These very small jobs had never warranted the expense or time required to bring in a big, imprecise, cable-actuated,
         track-driven shovel, so the trenches had always been dug by hand. Hydraulic backhoes attached to highly mobile tractors could
         do these jobs in less than an hour per house, and they became extremely popular with contractors building large tract subdivisions
         during the housing booms that followed World War II and the Korean War. These early backhoes were sold through tractor and
         implement dealerships accustomed to dealing with small customers.

      <p class="spb">The early users of hydraulic excavators were, in a word, <em class="calibre2">very</em> different from the mainstream customers of the cable shovel manufacturers—in size, in needs, and in the distribution channels
         through which they bought. They constituted a new value network for mechanical excavation. Interestingly, just as the performance
         of smaller-architecture disk drives was measured in different metrics than the performance of large drives (weight, ruggedness,
         and power consumption versus capacity and speed), the performance of the first backhoes was measured differently from the
         <a id="page67"></a>performance of cable-actuated equipment. The metrics featured most prominently in early product literature of hydraulic backhoes
         were shovel <em class="calibre2">width</em> (contractors wanted to dig narrow, shallow trenches) and the speed and maneuverability of the <em class="calibre2">tractor.</em> Figure 3.4, excerpted from an early product brochure from Sherman Products for its “Bobcat” hydraulic back-hoe, illustrates
         this. Sherman called its Bobcat a “digger,” showed it operating in tight quarters, and claimed it could travel over sod with
         minimum damage. The Bobcat was mounted on a Ford tractor. (Ford subsequently acquired the Sherman Bobcat line.) The featured
         attributes, of course, were simply irrelevant to contractors whose bread was buttered by big earthmoving projects. These differences
         in the rank-ordering of performance attributes defined the boundaries of the industry’s value networks.

         <a id="page68"></a>The solid line in Figure 3.3 charts the rate of improvement in bucket size that hydraulics engineers were able to provide
         in the new excavator architecture. The maximum available bucket size had reached <sup class="calibre6">3</sup><sub class="calibre16">8</sub> cubic yard by 1955, <sup class="calibre6">1</sup><sub class="calibre16">2</sub> cubic yard by 1960, and 2 cubic yards by 1965. By 1974, the largest hydraulic excavators had the muscle to lift 10 cubic
         yards. This trajectory of improvement, which was far more rapid than the rate of improvement demanded in any of the excavator
         markets, carried this disruptive hydraulics technology upward from its original market through the large, mainstream excavation
         markets. The use of hydraulic excavators in general contracting markets was given a boost in 1954 when another entrant firm
         in Germany, Demag, introduced a track-mounted model that could rotate on its base a full 360 degrees.
