<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_3">VALUE NETWORKS AND NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE DRIVERS OF FAILURE</h1>
      <p class="p">What, then, <em class="calibre2">does</em> account for the success and failure of entrant and established firms? The following discussion synthesizes from the history
         of the disk drive industry a new perspective on the relation between success or 
         <a id="page32"></a>failure and changes in technology and market structure. The concept of the <em class="calibre2">value network</em>—the context within which a firm identifies and responds to customers’ needs, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors,
         and strives for profit—is central to this synthesis.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_29">6</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_29"></a> Within a value network, each firm’s competitive strategy, and particularly its past choices of markets, determines its perceptions
         of the economic value of a new technology. These perceptions, in turn, shape the rewards different firms expect to obtain
         through pursuit of sustaining and disruptive innovations.
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_30">7</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_30"></a> In established firms, expected rewards, in their turn, drive the allocation of resources toward sustaining innovations and
         away from disruptive ones. This pattern of resource allocation accounts for established firms’ consistent leadership in the
         former and their dismal performance in the latter.
