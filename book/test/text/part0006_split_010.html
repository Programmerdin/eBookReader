<h1 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_10">SUMMARY</h1>
      <p class="p">There are several patterns in the history of innovation in the disk drive industry. The first is that the disruptive innovations
         were technologically straightforward. They generally packaged known technologies in a unique architecture and enabled the
         use of these products in applications where magnetic data storage and retrieval previously had not been technologically or
         economically feasible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The second pattern is that the purpose of advanced technology development 
         <a id="page24"></a>in the industry was always to <em class="calibre2">sustain</em> established trajectories of performance improvement: to reach the higher-performance, higher-margin domain of the upper right
         of the trajectory map. Many of these technologies were radically new and difficult, but they were not disruptive. The customers
         of the leading disk drive suppliers led them toward these achievements. Sustaining technologies, as a result, did not precipitate
         failure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The third pattern shows that, despite the established firmsâ€™ technological prowess in leading sustaining innovations, from
         the simplest to the most radical, the firms that led the industry in every instance of developing and adopting disruptive
         technologies were entrants to the industry, not its incumbent leaders.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This book began by posing a puzzle: Why was it that firms that could be esteemed as aggressive, innovative, customer-sensitive
         organizations could ignore or attend belatedly to technological innovations with enormous strategic importance? In the context
         of the preceding analysis of the disk drive industry, this question can be sharpened considerably. The established firms were,
         in fact, aggressive, innovative, and customer-sensitive in their approaches to sustaining innovations of every sort. But the
         problem established firms seem unable to confront successfully is that of <em class="calibre2">downward</em> vision and mobility, in terms of the trajectory map. Finding new applications and markets for these new products seems to
         be a capability that each of these firms exhibited once, upon entry, and then apparently lost. It was as if the leading firms
         were held captive by their customers, enabling attacking entrant firms to topple the incumbent industry leaders each time
         a disruptive technology emerged.
