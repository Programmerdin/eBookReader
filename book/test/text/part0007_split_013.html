      <p class="p">Once the start-ups had discovered an operating base in new markets, they realized that, by adopting sustaining improvements
         in new component technologies,
         <sup class="calibre6"><a href="part0007_split_021.html#endnote_text_43">20</a></sup>
         <a id="endnote_reference_43"></a> they could increase the capacity of their drives at a faster rate than their new market required. They blazed trajectories
         of 50 percent annual improvement, fixing their sights on the large, established computer markets immediately above them on
         the performance scale.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">The established firms’ views downmarket and the entrant firms’ views upmarket were asymmetrical. In contrast to the unattractive
         margins and market size that established firms saw when eyeing the new, emerging markets for simpler drives, the entrants
         saw the potential volumes and margins in the upscale, high-performance markets above them as highly attractive. Customers
         in these established markets eventually embraced the new architectures they had rejected earlier, because once their needs
         for capacity and speed were met, the new drives’ smaller size and architectural simplicity made them cheaper, faster, and
         more reliable than the older architectures. Thus, Seagate, which started in the desktop personal computer market, subsequently
         invaded and came to dominate the minicomputer, engineering workstation, and mainframe computer markets for disk 
         <a id="page47"></a>drives. Seagate, in turn, was driven from the desktop personal computer market for disk drives by Conner and Quantum, the
         pioneering manufacturers of 3.5-inch drives.
